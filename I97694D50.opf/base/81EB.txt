THE ENTRANCE GATE FOR THE WISE
Section III: Philosophical Debate
Having thus set forth the way for entering into exposition, (now) to ex-
plain the method of debat ing so that [one) will know how to accept and reject
philosophical tenets:
(III 1) The dialectical discussion of debate) has three parts): a prepara-
tion, an actual practice, and a conclusion. One should enter into debating
after determining [who] the two opponents and the witness [are), as the
preparation to cleanse the path of debate.
There are three (steps) for entering into a debate through a dialectical
discussion which consists of the acceptance of truth that accords with Dharma
(religious principle) and the rejection of error. [These three are:) (I) the
preparation, the cleansing of the path of debate in order to determine the
[identity of the opponents, (II) the actual practice, the settling of the
matter through assertions and replies for the sake of protecting the Doctrine,
and (III) the conclusion, a summarized communication (of what transpired) so that
the assembly can easily retain it.
1. The Preparation
Regarding the first of these [i.e. the preparation), one ought to debate
[only] after determining who these three people are: (a) the proponent who under-
takes to maintain his own philosophical tenets, (b) the respondent" who undertakes
to refute him, and (c) the witness' who undertakes truthfully to judge the faults
and merits of those two. Whereas to debate heedlessly without determining those
[participants) vould, [p. 110) like the quarrelling of vulgar people, be an occa-
sion for the dispraise of scholars. Consequently, one should enter into the sort
of] dialectical discussion that is capable of maintaining one's own doctrine (and]



is praised by learned men.
(Question: What kinds of things constitute occasions for defeat or for
the acknowledgment [of victory]' for the proponent and respondent?
This (answer) has three parts: (1) refuting the traditions of others, (2) stating
our own opinion, and (3) the elimination of objections. The first, the refuta-
tion of other traditions, ) is twofold: (a) refuting the traditions of (earlier)
Tibetans, and (b) refuting the [Nyāya) tradition of Akşapäda. For the first:
(III 2) They say there are sixteen occasions of defeat for the two opponents
and the witness.
Regarding the occasions of defeat, Tibetans say that there are sixteen
occasions of defeat: six for the proponent, being three [occasions of] defeat at
the time of answering and three (occasions of] defeat at the time of removing
defects; six for the respondent, being three [occasions of] defeat at the time of
questioning and three at the time of stating the defect; three [occasions of]
defeat for the witness at the time of his coming to a judgment; and one (occasion
of defeat] to which all are susceptible, which is not paying attention. Dharma-
kirti did not maintain this, for as he said in his Vādanyāya :
Not stating something that forms part of a sound proof and not stating
the logical defect [of the opponent's reasoning) are the occasions of
defeat for the two Copponents). I do not maintain any other [occasions
of defeat) because they are logically chacceptable."
Furthermore, those twelve things that are supposed) occasions of defeat
for the two opponents, if they are (genuine occasions of] defeat, can be included
somewhere among the four (classes of defeat] that those (basic] two can be divided
into: for the proponent the two defects of not stating the parts of a sound proof
[p. 111] and stating something besides the parts [of a sound proof), and for the
respondent, not to state the logical defect [in the proponent's argument) and to
state something that is not a logical defect. Anything not included within those
[four] is not a true occasion of defeat.
A witness is not susceptible to defeat, because as (Dharmakirti) said [in
the verse just quoted), "... Are the occasions of defeat for the two," and
because he did not mention that [defeat for a witness even in some [small]
section of [his) basic treatises."



325
(III 3) Some say that a witness is not necessary. Because one cannot know
how learned or stupid the opponents [themselves) will be if a learned vitness
does not judge it, [Dharmakirti) in the Vădanyāya taught that (a witness) is
necessary.
Some may think that a vitness is not necessary at the time of debate, for
this was not taught in the treatises on dialectics. [This opinion) is not cor-
rect, for as [Dharmakirti] said in the Vidanyaya:
[Noble debaters) will follow reasoning by way of a correct statement of
proof or a correct statement of the logical defect, so that the witness
will understand it directly. In that way noble persons debate in
accord with reasoning.13
Second, the refutation of the (Nyayatradition of Aksapada:
(III 4,5,6,7) There are twenty-two occasions of] defeat (in debate] taught
by the sage Akşapada:
[1] annihilation of one's own) thesis (such as through citing an incompat-
ible example) (pratijñāhant),
[2] (shifting to another thesis (prati jääntara),
[3] the thesis being in contradiction with the reason] (prati laviro-
dha),
[4] abandoning (one's] thesis (pratijñāsannyāsa),
[5] (shifting to another reason (het vantara),
[6] (shifting to) another (irrelevant topie (arthantara).
[7] meaninglessness i.e. uttering a string of meaningless syllables] (nir-
arthaka),
[8] unintelligibility [of the thesis to the respondent and witness, even
though stated three times) (avijñatartha) (III 4),
[9] incoherence (1.e., uttering unconnected words] (aparthaka),
[10] inappropriate sequence (in the steps of proof) (apraptakala),
[11] incompleteness [in the steps of proof) (nyüna),
[12] superfluity (in the steps of proof, such as citing more than one exam-
ple) (adhika),
[13] [needless] repetition (punarukta), (p. 112]
[14] not repeating (when one should repeat the assertions of the opponent]
(ananubhāsaņa).



326
[15] ignorance (of the thesis on the part of the respondent, even though the
witness understands it] (ajnana),
[16] lacking the confident composure [to reply correctly) (apratibhà).
[17] [falsely evading the debate by claiming to be distracted by other
affairs) (vikepa). (III 5)
[18] [indirectly admitting the charge [by simply leveling the same charge
against the opponent] (watānuſia),
[19] overlooking the censurable (paryanuyovopekşana),
[20] censuring the non-censurable (niranuyo iyanuyoga),
(21) not keeping to one's own] tenets (apasiddhanta), and
us logical reason (het vabhasa) (such as in a futile rejoinder
(jāti)). (III 6)
Regarding these, the glorious [Dharma]kirti explained some as not being
[occasions of) defeat. If they are defeats, he included them within the two
[basic classes of defeats).15 (III 7)
of these "twenty-two occasions for defeat," some of them are not (true)
occasions for defeat, while those that are should be included within the previous-
ly explained occasions for defeat of] not stating the parts of a sound proof and
the other [one). One should learn well how this is so from (my) Treasure of
Reasoning (Rigs paligter).
(III 8,9,10) There were twenty-four futile rejoinders (lat) [taught by
Akşapāda and refuted by Dignāga)." In the Pramāpasamuccaya, [Dignāga
refuted]:18
(la) futile rejoinder by balancing (or parity) with the co-presence [of
reason and assertion to be proved) (praptisanslati).
[16] futile rejoinder by balancing with no co-presence of reason and thesis
to be proved) (aprāpti--),
[2] futile rejoinder by balancing with the (impossibility of the reason (in
the three times ] Chetu- ahetu--).
[3] futile rejoinder by balancing with permanence li.e. arguing that things
are permanently impermanent] (nitya--),
[4) futile rejoinder by balancing with the unspoken (1.e. arguing that prior
to the act of stating the reason proving the impermanence of sound (here
the reason is that sound is produced through effort), this reason (produc-
tion through effort) did not exist and therefore the thesis (that sound is
impermanent) could not follow then] *anukta--?),



[5] futile rejoinder by balancing with the unproduced [1.e. arguing that
though sound may be impermanent after its production, it is not so when
unproduced] (anutpatti--),
[6) futile rejoinder by balancing with difference of effect (kärya--),
[7] futile rejoinder by balancing with agreement [of a quality of the exam-
ples) (sādharnya--).
[8] futile rejoinder by balancing with disagreement [of a quality of the
examples) (vaidharmya--),
[9] futile rejoinder by balancing with alternative qualities of the subject
and example) (vikalpa--),
[10] futile rejoinder by balancing with non-difference [between the parts of
the "syllogism" on account of qualities they hold in common) (avies--),
[11] futile rejoinder by balancing with perceiving (that the thesis is pos-
sible without the stated reason, or that there are other reasons for the
thesis] (upalabdhi--) (III 8).
[12] futile rejoinder by balancing with doubt [about the particular meaning
of the reason) sapkaya--),
[13] futile rejoinder by balancing with [a contrariety] implied by the cir
cumstances (arthāpatti--), and
[14] futile rejoinder by balancing with an entailment of a necessary conse-
quence that the reason must be established for the example itself) (pro-
sanga--),
And in the Nyayapariksa (Dignāga refuted the following]:19
[15] futile rejoinder by balancing with enlarging (the subject by attempting
to apply an additional characteristic to the subject because that charac-
teristic is possessed by the example) (utkarsd--).
[16] futile rejoinder by balancing with decreasing the argument by at
tempting to subtract a characteristic because that characteristic is
lacking from the example) (apakarşa--).
[17] futile rejoinder by balancing with the questionability (of the example,
1.e. whether it should not also become the subject of a proof of its
possessing the predicate, just like the subject itself] (varuya--).
(18) futile rejoinder by balancing with the unquestionability of the sub-
ject, i.e. that its predicate need not be proven if the example's posses-
sion of the predicated quality is unquestioned) (avarova-),
(19) futile rejoinder by balancing with a different line of] reasoning
[leading to the opposite conclusion without disputing the proponent's
original thesis] (upapatti--),



328
[20] futile rejoinder by balancing with a counter-example (pratidratanta),
(III 9) [p. 113]
[21) futile rejoinder by balancing with the thing to be proved (1.e. arguing
that the soundness of the example needs a full proof just like the proban-
dum, for otherwise one cannot be sure that it too possesses the predicated
quality] (sādhya--),
[22] futile rejoinder by balancing with impermanence (as a supposed universal
characteristic shared by all things because all things possess some sort of
similarity with an impermanent pot] (anitya--),
[23] futile rejoinder by balancing with the point at issue (by calling it
into doubt through an opposing proposition in which some agreeing charac-
teristic of the subject is made the basis for a different reason and
example) (prakarana--), and
[24] futile rejoinder by balancing with a mistimed (reason, 1.e. a reason
adduced for a time in which it does not hold good] (külitita--),
Because these were refuted by Dignāga, Dharmakirti disregarded them. (III 10)
[Dharmakirti) held that these twenty-four futile rejoinders are all to
be appropriately included within the three [categories of contradictory, un-
certain and unestablished [reasons), and that if they do not go into those three,
they are indeed sound. For as he said in his Vādanyaya: "... Since they are
included within the fallacies of reason Chetvābhāsa) in whatever way 18 appro-
priate. Because Dignāga refuted these futile rejoinders at length, the author
of the Pramāņavārttika passed over them (without further comment).
Second, one's own system:
(III 11) The occasions for defeat (in debate) are just the four which come
from the [basic] two. No others are needed.
As [ Dharmakirti) said in the Vādanyaya:
Not stating something that forma part of a sound proof and not stating
the logical defect [of the opponent's reasoning) are the occasions of
defeat for the two Copponents). I do not maintain any other occasions
of defeat) because they are logically unacceptable.
[Thus Dharmakirti's) opinion is that the proponent has two [possible) occasions of
defeat: not stating something that forms part of a sound proof, and stating
something that is not part [of a sound proof]. The respondent (also) has two: not



329
stating the logical defect of the opponent's reasoning) and stating something
that is not a defect [to be a defect). [He holds) that such [faults) are the
occasions for defeat, whereas anything else is not an occasion for defeat.“
(III 12) To debate in accordance with the Dharma. [p. 114] one should
debate for the sake of dispelling erroneous notions, but one should not
[debate] under the influence of attachment and hatred, desiring victory and
for the sake of vanquishing the adversary.
A noble person should debate as proponent or respondent for the sake of
dispelling error and for making understood the unmistaken facts of the matter,
with the aim of maintaining his own doctrine. But debate that is motivated by
desire and hatred, and aimed at one's own victory and the vanquishing of the
adversary is not accepted by noble persons because it cannot protect the doctrine
and because it develops into anger and enmity. For as Vasubandhu has stated in
detail:
Someone who debates only out of a desire to win is not nobles, whereas
[a noble debater?) resolves doubts about that very (matter?].
(III 13) Therefore a [true) scholar will defeat (others in debate] by
truthfully stating the defects of [the opponent's] philosophical tenets,
whereas a scholar will condemn [attacks against) personal faults and the
praising of oneself, for these are the causes for [birth in miserable
existences.
The debating of a noble person establishes his own philosophical tenets,
and it refutes the error in the tenets of others while not refuting that which is
not erroneous. [But] to be deceitful, to praise oneself, to dispraise others, to
torment others by picking out their faults, to maintain one's own philosophical
tenets out of attachment even though they are erroneous, to cavil at the tenets of
others [p. 115) out of hatred even though they are not erroneous, and to approve
of overcoming the mental composure of the opponent by way of such things as
nonsensical prattle, laughter, dancing, changing one's recitation, extreme speed
(in one's speech), excessively high and low tone of voice, and unclear articula-
tion--all these things) amount to a defeat for oneself either by way of not
stating something that makes up part of a sound proof or by stating something that



330
does not make up a proof. These methods are not capable of defeating the other
[debater), and (such) debating that does not accord with Dharma (1.e. with reli-
gious principle] is something that learned persons should avoid since it is a
cause for birth in evil realms of existence.
Third, the elimination of objections:
(III 14) If one says that it is permissible for even a noble person to speak
deceitfully for the sake of defending his doctrine, [I answer that) through
deceit one cannot uphold a doctrine. Such [deceita) have been rebutted [by
Dharmakirti] in the Vādanyaya.
Some non-Buddhist Indian sectarians in order to defend their doctrine also
proceed deceitfully, calling out "I have won" even though at that time the oppo-
nent is (merely sitting silently. Concerning (such practices), if one has to
defend one's doctrine through deceit, the doctrine itself will become impure. And
1f the matter at issue can become established merely by (the opponent] becoming
silent, there would ensue an extreme consequence [i.e. a fault of overextension
(atiprasanga) of the term "defeat") because even silence caused through three-
tening with a weapon or with fire would then amount to such an occasion for
defeat).49 [As Dharmakirti] said in the Vādanyāya: "A noble person will not
engage in (debate) nor compose treatises for the sake of tormenting others. 30
II.
The Actual Practice [of Debating]
(III 15) For the two opponents to debate maintaining their own philosophical
tenets [p. 116) is the traditional practice of the learned men of the past.
(Great masters] such as Dharmakirti when debating with the non-Buddhist
sectarians used to debate adhering to the philosophical tenets of the Buddhists
and with the opponent maintaining the tenets of a teacher such as Kanāda. But
for someone who has no capability of maintaining a doctrine to extract any sort of
definition or fragment of texts and to say "Set forth a formal argument!" is the
debate by which a childish person tests his knowledge. It is not the debate of
scholars who adhere to tenets. Such [elementary debate) is explained as being



331
debate that is proper to the occasion for explicating (texts), but it is not
suitable as debate that is proper to the occasion of debating, for [by it one)
cannot accept or reject tenets. It may possibly also be an occasion for entering
into (real debate] if one inquires in that way in order to find an occasion for
accepting and rejecting tenets."
(III 16) There appears in some scriptures on reasoning a respondent who
refutes the proponent's tenets without affirming tenets of his own).
Some Madhyamikas without admitting tenets of their own refute whatever the
proponent maintains, whether it is maintained as existent, non-existent, or some-
thing else. 52 For as the Scarya Krya [Nagarjuna) said in his Vigrahavyavartani
29):
that fault.
If I possessed any thesis, I would therefore possess
Because I possess no thesis, I am certainly without fault.
(III 17,18) Even if one affirms tenets, Ip. 117) during the time of debating
it is not necessary to affirm every tenet taught in the basic scriptures. It
is the traditional practice of scholars to prove just the tenets of the
particular occasion of debate (III 17). For example, when proving the exis-
tence of external objects, the texts (which teach) Vijñapti do not disprove
[the position maintaining external objects in this connection. Likewise one
should apply [this principle] to all systems of tenets. (III 18)
Even though one debates having affirmed Buddhist tenets, on an occasion of
refuting non-Buddhist Indian sectarians one should debate having affirmed (the
existence of] external objects in accordance with the Sautrantika [view), and
[one's position) is not disproven (if the opponent) says in debate: "You are in
contradiction with the explanation which is found in your own texts that [all
externally appearing phenomena are mind." Likewise [the alleged fault consti-
tutes no real disproof 1f) when one is affirming Mind-Only (1.e. Vi jänavāda)
(tenets, the opponent) asserts, "The external objects taught in the Sutras must
also be what you assert," or when debating as a Madhyamika (if the opponent) says,
"Since ViRapti is also taught in your Sutras, it should be something that you
assert." And likewise even among non-Buddhist Indian sectarians, when a Sankhya
adherent ways to a Vaišeşika, "When you state your reason proving the impermanence



332
should become a thesis [for you), and consequently since you contradict that,
there is a contradiction with your thesis," the alleged fault does not amount to
any (real) disproof. For even though one has affirmed a system of tenets, one's
thesis is just that immediate matter which one is maintaining, and one does not
affirm every point [taught in the scriptures of one's school] with different
motives in mind. 35
As [Dharmakirti) said in the Pramānavārttika [II 46ab):
Why follow tenets that contain matters not established through sound
knowledge?36 (p. 118]
(III 19) The two types of] debating--through scriptures and through
reasoning--are alike if one knows them well. Nevertheless, with reference to
the two objects of cognition ["manffest" phenomena and "hidden" phenomena),
reasoning on the basis of direct perception and inference can falsify [those
two).
[Concerning debate through scriptures and debate through reasoning: Just
as all such things as refutation and proof, independent "syllogism" and logical
consequence, reason and proposition to be proved, and defects of language or
defects of sense can amount to] faults and strengths when one is debating through
reasoning, so also when debating through scriptures, that very procedure operates
similarly if one has a good understanding of it. Nevertheless, the two means of
knowledge engage as their objects (respectively] manifest phenomena and hidden
phenomena, and the things which act to prove or falsify (them) are also direct
perception and inference, whereas here the scriptures do not come into play."
(Question:] What is the scope of the scriptures (in debate)? (Reply:]
(III 20) When investigating the third object of cognition [1.e. "completely
hidden" phenomena, one's position) is disproven if one contradicts one's own
scriptures. As for example the contradiction occuring] when someone
proclaims that ablutions purify evils and that harming [sentient creatures)
is a religious virtue, while teaching that desire, etc., are evils and that
freedom from desire is a religious virtue.



333
When investigating such completely hidden phenomena as the existence of]
previous and subsequent lives, the causality of moral actions, and the particular
features of the fortunate realms and miserable realms of existence, one must
base oneself on the scriptures. [p. 119] for as it is sold in Pramāņavārttika
IV 51cd]:
When one passes on to the third topic [i.e. "completely hidden" phen
42
mena), one is justified in accepting the vitness of treatises.
[Question: How can particular characteristics be established as true or false
with regard to a basic [subject--a "completely hidden" phenomenon--which itself
is not established? [Answer:) Indeed such a question is reasonable. The correct
answer is this: When a Buddhist and a *Vaidika (Mimasaka) debate, both opponents
maintain the truth of the existence of previous and subsequent lives, the cau-
sality of moral actions, etc. And they agree that deeds produced from desire,
hatred and confusion are evil, that actions (accomplished] without desire, anger
and nescience are virtuous (or salutory), that evils (cause) the round of Cyclic
Existence (sansara), and that if one is freed of evils that is liberation. But
they debate concerning their disagreeing scriptures (which explain the methods
[for achieving liberation). The "Veda" states:
[I] one performs ablutions at the river shores of Gangūdvara (Hari-
dvara), Kuskvarta, Bilvaka, Nī laparvata and Kanakhala, it is not pos-
sible that one will be born again."
The recitation of this constitutes (for the Mimaņsaka) an internal contradiction
of his own scriptures. The root of evil deeds are mental events such as desire,
and it is not consistent to wash the body which has no direct connection with it,
while not washing the mind, which is its root. This is just like setting fire to
the forest for the purpose of killing the creatures of the ocean.
Our scriptures [describe the partial suppression of the emotional defile-
ments with] such words as:
Those in whom lust predominates should think of the bodies of the
opposite sex as) unclean meat and fat, and
[While concerning the complete termination (of the emotional defilements), it is
said: [p. 120]



334
o desire, I have understood your root: (you) arose from conceptual
thought. Since I do not conceptualize [a self] in connection with you,
to aggregates (skandhas)], therefore (that desire) will not arise in
me, 48
Accordingly, [the doctrine of our scriptures is that] by cutting off egoity (i.e.
the psychological postulation of a self), which is the seed of Cyclic Existence,
the emotional defilements which they produce will cease. Through their cessation
one is freed from suffering, just as through the exhaustion of fuel a fire dies
out, and by virtue of that, smoke does not arise.
Likewise, [for the WVaidika] there are contradictions between his own
texts. While he maintains that the cause of [birth in) fortunate realms of
existence is virtue, [there are texts of his that say] such things as "Katriya
should kill Ksatriya." As for the Buddhist, there are no contradictions between
his scriptures. [His texts contain consistent statements such as "Through moral-
ity one goes to the higher realms of existence," and "Non-meritorious [deeds]
propel one to miserable realms of existence."
If one objects that even in the case of the Buddhist himself there are seen
contradictions between his Sūtras:
(III 21) Someone may object that because in the Sugata's scriptures the two
[main schools]--Srāvaka and Mahāyāna--have doctrinal formulations that for
the most part disagree, those (Buddhist scriptures) are contradictory.S2 In
that case.
[Objection:] In the Buddhist basic texts the two main divisions), Sravaka
and Mahāyāna, generally conflict regarding their philosophical tenets. In parti-
cular, (within the Srävaka there are the eighteen (schools) that developed from
the four basic communities, which appear to conflict to a great extent in their
theory and practice. Also in the Mahāyāna (p. 121) there are the two-Päramitä
and Mantra- which appear for the most part to be unalike. Also within the Paramita
there are the dissimilar Mind-Only (Yogācāra) and Madhyamaka, and al
Mantra the four classes of Tantra appear to have different doctrinal formulations.
And since your own scriptures [thus] conflict, there can be no relying on them.
[Reply:]



335
(III 22) If one understands (the different inclinations of) individuals, the
stages of Introduction, and the methods of explanation, there is no contra-
diction.
[Reply:) It is not contradictory to lead through skillful expedients--
according to whether the individual [to be taught) has inclinations toward an
inferior or the highest [goal], whether [he] applies himself for his own benefit
or for the benefit of others, whether he delights in deep and vast [truths).
and by way of interpretable and definitive truth. For as Ārya (Nagarjuna] said
[in Yuktişastikā 30):
To one who seeks for reality, one should first teach "Everything
exists." One who understands objects [on the relative level] and is
without attachment [should) afterward [be taught) "isolation" (vivikta-
ta = šūnyati).54
And (as Nāgār juna said in Mulamadhyamakakārika XVIII 6]:
[The Buddhas) indicated both "A self exists" and they indicated "A self
does not exist." The Buddhas also taught, "Self and absence of self do
not exist at all..55
(III 23) Those who do not understand such a formulation debate thinking that
(the doctrines) are contradictory. But [p. 122] if one understands well,
there are no contradictions.
[Some) fools think that there are scriptural contradictions in the (Bud-
dha's) teaching of different levels of vehicle which have in mind individuals of
superior, middling, [or inferior) faculties, (different] constituent elements and
inclinations [in the minds of those to be trained], and (the existence of su-
perior and inferior stages. And they imagine contradictiona) in his uttering of
different ways of exposition that take into account the differing dispositions of
individuals. But if one has a good knowledge of the "six limits" of the Sage's
intention, there is no contradiction."
(III 24,25,26) The apparently contradictory doctrinal vehicles were taught
so that individuals would gradually be introduced into religion). [State-



336
ments such as "Father and mother are to be killed"[were uttered with the
intended meaning that [the fetters of] deeds (karma) and the emotional de
filements should be destroyed). (III 24)
Such [doctrines) as "the womb of the Tathāgata (exists]" were given for the
sake of guiding those who possess egoity (self-postulation, ahankara). Such
statements as "Awakening is won by killing" refer to the slaying of egoity.
(III 25)
Learned men should give this answer to those who debate because of such
(apparent contradictions.” (III 26)
These were intermediate verses. 60
(III 27) On occasions of debate on the scriptures there is nothing incon-
sistent about posing questions concerning matters in the scriptures, or about
posing questions concerning completely hidden objects (of cognition), even
those not (taught in the scriptures).
When debating on the scriptural teachings, it is proper to inquire and it
is not an occasion for laughter if one asks questions concerning the import of the
Three Baskets of Scripture Tripitaka) (such as) about the disciplines of mo-
rality. [p. 123] discriminative knowledge and meditative trance, or asks ques-
tions about the import of the four classes of Tantras, (such as) concerning the
(processes of] "ripening" and "liberating," or asks questions about completely
hidden phenomena not taught in the Sütras or Tantras concerning places of refuge
other than the Three Jewels, such as Isvara, or concerning theories different
from the [four) "seals" which are the marks of the doctrine for theory, such as
a theory of a self or person, or concerning modes of conduct different from the
Middle Way, such as physical pleasures and mortifications.
And as for answering those questions):
(III 28) In Sutras (the Buddha) uttered answers [to questions) in four ways:
by absolute affirmation (ekamsena). by drawing distinctions (vibhava).
by closer questioning (pariprccha). and by setting aside the matter (as
meaningless or unfruitfull (sthapaniya).' (p. 124] to such questions as
those regarding the inevitability of] death, [the inevitability of birth,
the excellence [of human birth), or the qualities of the self, respectively.



337
The Blessed One taught four methods for answering questions. [1] To the
question "Will all beings that are born die or not?" he answered: "They definitely
will die," thus answering by absolute affirmation. [2] When asked, "Will all
beings who die be born again or not?" he answered: "Those who possess egoity (ego-
postulation) will be born. If they have no egoity they will not be born." Thus
he answered by drawing distinctions. [3] When asked, "Is it good to be born as a
human?" he answered by questioning: "[Good) in relation to what? In relation to
the evil realms of existence it is good. With regard to the gods, it is bad."
[4] When asked, "Is the self permanent or impermanent?" he answered: "Since the
self is not established, both permanence and impermanence are not established with
regard to it," thus setting aside [the question as meaningless). As (Vasubandhu]
stated in the [Abhidharma-) kosa [22]:
Elucidating by absolute affirmation, by distinguishing questioning,
and setting aside, [the Buddha answered] such Iquestions as those
about death, rebirth, excellence, whether the skandhas are identical
with) the self [or] other [than it), and so forth.
[The Buddha) stated in the Sutras that such is the correct system for answering
all questions of such types.
Furthermore, [when the wandering religious mendicant Dirghanakha said to
the Blessed One, "O Gautama, I cannot accept anything," (the Buddha) replied, "Can
you accept or not the statement 'I cannot accept'?" If one can accept it, one's
non-acceptance is destroyed. If one cannot accept that, not to be able to accept
non-acceptance is just to be able to accept for a negated negation is an
assertion. This is what [the Buddha) intended [by his question). The wandering
ascetic fell silent. 74
Also (when) the Kșapaņakas (Jaina ascetics?) asked the Buddha fourteen
questions beginning, "O Gautama, does this world have a posterior] limit?" the
Buddha remained silent. As [Nāgār juna) said in the Ratnāvall (I 73-74d):
When asked if the world has a (posterior) lisit, the Jina remained
silent. For the very reason that he did not teach the deep doctrine to
those beings who were not fit receptacles, learned persons understand
the Omniscient One to be all-knowing."
Therefore [questions) that (the Buddha) did not elucidate are to be included
within "answering by setting aside [the questions as unhelpful or fruitless)."



(III 29) On occasions of (debating on) scriptures, there is no incompati-
bility in dialectical ansvers of this sort. [p. 125] There is also no incom-
patibility (in the use of such answers) for (debating through) reasoning.
Nevertheless, they are difficult for the ignorant to understand.
On occasions of scriptural (debates), such [ways of] debating are suitable
because this is the right occasion for them, and such [methods) can be employed
also for (debating through] reasoning. Nevertheless, since [these things) are not
easily understood by the ignorant, (in the latter context] one should give answers
which are recognized in [the science of reasoning.
(III 30) Otherwise (one should give] two kinds of answers (when debating
on scriptures: one should refute that (argument] by means of Iquotations
from) scripture or by means of reasoning based on scripture.
Otherwise, on an occasion of debate on scriptural teachings, there exists
answering by means of just that scripture which is right for that occasion, and by
means of other reasoning that applies to that scripture.
(III 31,32) And as for scripture, that which is connected with the particu-
lar (scriptural] context about which one is debating is "scripture." Any
other scriptures that do not belong to that (scriptural] context and that are
not maintained by the proponent are not [capable of causing the defect [of
textual contradiction). (III 31) Just as for example even though there is
contradiction between the Srāvaka and Mahāyāna, and between such things as
Viñapti and Nihavabhava, this is no detect [for one who espouses one of
these). (III 32)
When debating back and forth basing oneself on scriptures, (what one's)
scripture is [is determined by] whatever one has affirmed as one's own level of
vehicle (e.g. Śrävakayana or Mahāyāna), as one's particular theory, and as the
immediately relevant text. For example, when one affirms the Vinaya ("Monastic
Discipline") [as the general scriptural basis for debate), one's scripture is that
which is maintained as the [Vinaya] scriptures of each of the four basic monastic
communities, and consequently if a contradiction occurs within that, it is a
scriptural (p. 126) contradiction. But when one has affirmed (for instance, the



339
particular Vinaya of) the Sarvastivāda, even if there occurs a contradiction with
the scriptures of the other monastic communities such as the Sthaviravada, that
will not constitute a scriptural contradiction. And when one has affirmed such
[Vinaya systems) as the Sthaviravada, there is no defect of scripture even though
contradictions occur with such schools as the Sarvastivāda."
And likewise, though in the Srāvaka (Vinaya] 1t amounts to an offense
Cápatti) to accept gold and silver, according to the Mahayana it is taught to be
an offense not to accept it. And though for the Sravaka (eating) meat that is
pure in three ways (trikot 1parisuddha) is not an offense, the Mahayana teaches
[meat eating] to be an offense. And while the Sravakayana teaches that austere
observances such as silence and fasting are offenses, in some Tantras it is taught
t..at the Mantra (practices) are to be realized by the observance of temporary vows
of Easting and silence. These and other examples of apparent contradictions will
amount to real] scriptural contradictions if in that very context, in that very
text of one's own (school), those practices are taught as to be practiced in the
opposite way. But as for teachings given for different occasions, they are not
contradictory. (This is because they are (mere) divisions of conduct, just like
the giving of different medicines for different diseases.
Likewise for theory too, the texts of the different schools may appear to
be in contradiction: in the Srāvakayana) the subject and object which are com-
posed of "atoms" and moments are explained as being ultimate reality, (whereas)
the follower of the Mind-Only teaches that the experience of non-dual cognition is
ultimate reality, and the Madhyanika holds that all factors of existence (dharmas)
are without own-nature. If the texts affirmed by one's own philosophical school
disprove [these], there is indeed a contradiction. But if there is no contradic-
tion between one's own texts, (merely) to contradict another (school) is no de-
fect, for one has not affirmed that (other school) as one's own system of tenets.
It is just as in the steps of farming (in different places and seasons). 04
Furthermore, other texts of one's own school) that contradict one's (posi-
tion) will become acceptable if one knows how to establish one's own tenets as
being of ascertained meaning or as of direct intent, after establishing through
the force of reasoning that the contradictory text) is of interpretable meaning
(p. 127] or [was taught ) with special intent. But if one does not know how to
establish in that way (that the text one follows is of definitive meaning, etc.)
by means of reasoning, one cannot escape a contradiction of scripture.
(III 33) If [a text of one's tradition) contradicts the scriptures one
maintains, one should explain it by distinguishing ito Intention. If one



340
does not understand the intention, there occurs an occasion of defeat.
That was a summarizing stanza.
Otherwise
(III 34) When debating by way of reasoning, one should debate clearly,
having distinguished whether one is or is not following philosophical tenets.
When debating following reasoning, that reasoning too [is to be used for
benefitting one's own doctrine. The debating back and forth by the proponent and
respondent [is to be done) for the purpose of upholding their own doctrine, with
each maintaining the tenets of Buddhist or non-Buddhist ("Tirthika"). But to
debate heedlessly with no wish to uphold a doctrine and with the aim of testing
each other's knowledge, 11ke the argument of fools, is not the debating of noble
persons, but it is merely crafty people amazing the Ignorant. Therefore it should
be determined whether (the opponents) are or are not affirming tenets. And if
they are maintaining them, then both should debate maintaining the basic texts of
a system of tenets.
(III 35) If [a debater says that he does not follow any philosophical
tenets, by determining his subject of debate he vill usually [be seen to]
take some philosophical position. (p. 128]
Some ignorant persons making out to be learned may say, "I do not affirm
tenets, but I maintain whatever I can through reasoning." In that connection, one
first has to come to an agreement regarding the basic subject of debate. For if
nothing whatsoever such as existence or non-existence, permanence or annihilation,
truth or falsity, or Cyclic Existence (sapsāra) or Extinction (drvana) can be
found to be acceptable or unacceptable, there will not occur any occasion for
debating. But when one (finds) something acceptable or unacceptable to debate
about, that very thing which one affirms as acceptable becomes one's tenet. If
either existence or non-existence is acceptable, then there results a tenet that
maintains either existence or non-existence. And if permanence or annihilation
are acceptable, there results the speculative view asserting eternalismo
hilation. Likewise no matter what one affirms as existent or non-existent--
whether truth or falsity, Cyclic Existence or Extinction, or whatever--it is
impossible not to fall within the purview of some Buddhist or non-Buddhist system
of tenets of that sort. Consequently just the fault expressed concerning those



(philosophical systems] applies to that debater too).
(III 36) If [a debater] does not take sides with any philosophical position,
by determining what his initial position (pūrvapaka) [is], [his stand) will
usually be seen to be the reasoning of an ignorant person.
If a person at the time of debating will not affirm tenets no matter how
one Investigates [his views), [he may be either someone who does not affirm
[tenets out of ignorance or someone who does not affirm (then) out of the fear
that some logical defect may arise. If it is as in the first case, what is the
need for him to accept (tenets)? Who would debate with an ox? If it is as in the
second case, one should ask him) if he affirms or does not affirm non-affirma-
tion. If he affirms it, he abandons his thesis of not affirming, for he has
affirmed non-affirmation, just as the designation of something) as "nameless" has
become a name. If he does not affir non-affirmation, an affirmation occurs, for
a negated negation is an assertion [p. 129), just as if something is not non-blue,
it is blue.87
it is impossible that he
(III 37) If a person is) expert [in reasoning),
not follow some tenets.
There are two ways for persons whose minds have been trained in reasoning
not to affirm theses (pratina): deceitfully not to affirm and truthfully not to
affirm. [An example of the first is the Sankhya (philosopher) who argues, "Con-
posite [things such as the eyes and other sense organs) exist for the use of
another," thus deviously affirming a "use of another" that they do not [in fact]
maintain, while not expressly maintaining the really intended [thesis), which is
that the sense organs function for the sake of self (1.e. for the sake of an
atman].00 Or [another example of such deception) is the Carvākas, who assert a
thesis that they do not maintain, while not affirming what they (in fact main-
tain, such as in the argument formulation of "possessing a second" (sadvitiyapra-
yora). [These views) the Acarya Asanga declared to be "devious theories."
[Another group is) the Vätsiputriyas who make no affirmation, saying "The
self f1.e. the pudgalal is unstateable as permanent and Impermanent." This
(theory) the Arya (Asanga] called "a non-affirming theory and included it
within "mistaken theories.93



342
The second [way of not affirmingl, not to affirm (any thesis) truthfully,
is the correct theory of the Madhyamaka if one understands, for the real nature
of things which is free from discursive elaborations is beyond knowing or ex-
pressing, because it is not an object of language or mind. For as it is said
(in the Vimalakirtinirdesa):
The son of the Conqueror remains without speaking. Not speaking itself
explains at great length.
And as [Nāgār juna] said in the Ratnāvall (1 616-62d):
Ask the people in the world--the Samkhya, the Aulūkya (Valseșika?).
together with the Nirgrantha (Jaina ascetics)--if they maintain some-
thing going beyond existence and non-existence. Therefore one should
know that the teaching of "the profound immortal doctrine of the
Buddhas which is beyond existence and non-existence" (p. 130] is the
special wealth of the Dharma,
Therefore the non-Buddhist sectarian who while possessing affirmations deceitfully
denies them is like a thief who does not admit (his crime). The Madhyamika who
does not affirm is like one who has not stolen and who does not admit (any crime).
Thus there is a great difference.
(III 38,39) If there is no maintaining of any affirmation whatsoever, under
examination two ways of not affirming) will emerge. If they are not main-
tained because (ultimate reality) is free from discursive elaborations, that
will be the Madhyamaka tenet if it is understood. If someone) cannot bring
himself to affirm [his theses] even though he has some, his [theory] 18
explained as a deceitful speculative view.
That was a summarizing verse.
(III 40) Some maintain philosophical tenets that are an intermingling of
dissimilar tenets. If any of the combined tenets) are defective, they
should be individually refuted. If they have no defect one should follow
them.



343
Some people combine and affirm various different tenets. For example, some
maintain the simultaneous apprehension of a sense-object by (sensory] cognition,
combining the Vaibhāşika and Sautrantika. And some combine the Sautrantika and
Vijfapti system, saying (they are followers of the Mind-Only i.e. the Citta-
matra or Yogacara) who have affirmed external objects. And some combine the
Sautrantika and Madhyamaka, resulting in a "Madhyamika who follows the Sūtras"
(udo ade spyod pa'1 dbu ma pa), and some combine the Mind-Only and Madhyamaka (to
form a] Yogacara-Madhyamaka. Those who maintain such (combinations) as the
above should use reasoning (p. 131 ] to refute such defects [1.e. incompatible
tenets as exist in those combined systems), and if there is no defect [of
incompatibility) one should accept (those tenets with a mind of rectitude.
(III 41) The philosophical tenets that are adhered to by learned men are
two: Buddhist and non-Buddhist sectarian. [Anything) besides those are
(fictitious) tenets that have been haphazardly considered by fools.
The Buddhist tenets pacify the sufferings of Cyclic Existence and place one
in the bliss of the Saints. They affire direct perception (as the means
cognizing] manifest phenomena, inference for cognizing] hidden phenomena, and
scriptures which are not falsified by reasoning for [the cognition of completely
hidden phenomena. They are something adhered to by learned men who have con-
sidered it thoroughly: they are a resting place (resorted to] by the world of men
together with the gods.
As for the non-Buddhist Indian sectarian [tenets], they were previously
cultivated since a long time ago [and] have been thoroughly considered through the
fully developed discriminative understanding of the ordinary individual (prthag-
jana). They are based on the path of the person in the world. To a small extent
they are capable of discerning the suitable and unsuitable for ordinary people who
are concerned only with this life. And they are something that is worthy of
refutation by learned persons.
Thus these two are suitable as objects for learned persons to prove or
refute. But new philosophical tenets which are other than (Buddhist and non-
Buddhist Indian sectarian) and which were fabricated by ignorant persons are
empty of reasoning [and] In contradiction with the scriptures. [They are] false-
hoods concocted by "non-virtuous friends" [i.e. sham spiritual teachers for the
sake of (acquiring the necessities of life, (and they are] tenets upheld as their
own by fools out of desire and hatred. But since they originate from no authentic
source, they are indeed unworthy of refutation or proof. Nevertheless, if errors



344
spread excessively like weeds growing in a field, they will hurt the doctrine of
the Buddha. Consequently, one should appropriately refute them by means of scrip-
ture and reasoning. For even if passionate and angry fools do not understand,
it will be understood by learned men who dvell in rectitude. [p. 132]
(III 42) Here in the Land of Snows there also exist many tenets of fools
that are different from [Buddhist and non-Buddhist Indian sectarian tenets).
Because fools can easily understand [those), learned men have usually ignored
them.
That was an intermediate verse.
(III 43) Within the Indian non-Buddhist sectarians there are five [schools)
of speculative dialecticians: (1) the *Vaidika (Mīmāņsa), (2) Såņkhya, (3)
Aulükya (Vaiseşika), (4) Kşapanaka (Jaina), and (5) Carvaka.
Although there are inconceivably many speculative views of the non--Buddhist
sectarians (Tirthikas), in the [Madhyamakah daya vitti] Tarkajvālā [of Bhavavive-
ka) they were summarized into one hundred. If one summarizes those, they can
be reduced to the universally recognized five classes of speculative dialecti-
cians. And [as for those, [the following terms are synonyms (and refer to
the Mimāņsa-Vedānta]:
"Followers of the Veda ("Vaidika: rig byed pe) which was established from the
beginning"
"Followers of the old" (Purva-[Mīmāņsa]?)
"Followers of the secretly spokea" (Tib.: gsang bar amra ba pa)
"Followers of Jaimini" (Jaiminiya)
Mimāņsaka
Smarta
Brahma (Brahma-almamsalca? A branch of the Uttara-nimaņsa or Vedānta)
[The following terms) are synonyms:
Samkhya
Kapila ("Followers of Kapila")
"Followers of the self-originated" (Tib. rang skye ba)
"Followers of the thirty [categories)" (lib.: sum cu pa)



345
The term "followers of Prabhakara" (Tib.: goal byed pa) is according to the
context an accepted designation for either the *Vaidika or the Samkhya.
[The following terms] are synonyms (and refer to the Nyaya-Vaidetka):
Aulūkya ("followers of the doctrine of Uluka")
Kūņāda ("followers of the doctrine of Kaņāda")
Vaišeşika
Natyāyika
"Those who follow the six categories [of the Vaiseikal" (Tib.: tshia ki don
drug pa
[The following terms) are synonyms (and refer to the Jaina school):
Ksapanaka ("tastera")
"Followers of the Ryabha Jina" (Tib.rgyal ba dan pa ba)
"Those who follow the nine categories" (Tib.: tshig si don dy pa)
Āfivika [?] (Thb.: arog gi sde tahan pa
Nirgrantha ("those freed from hindrances"; Tib.+ "dzom med pa)
Nagna ("naked mendicant"; Tib.: acer bu pa)
Digambara ("sky-clad"; Tib.: phyors kyi gos can)
"Space-clad" (Tib.: nam mkha'i gos can, another possible rendering of Dig-
ambara?)
Those four (main) schools are called "propounders of eternalism" because they
maintain that moral causation is true.
(The following terms] are synonyms (and refer to the Materialist school):
Carvaka
Lokāyata
Uccheda-drstika ("adherents of the theory of annihilation")
Nastika ("deniers, nihilists")
Bärhaspatya ("followers of Bphaspati" (the originator of the Lokayata
aphorisms]) [p. 133]
"Asserters that nature is the only) cause" (T1b.: no bo nyid rayur smra ba
Some Tibetans say the Lokayata adherent (Tib. Tayang pan pa) is so called because
he does not maintain the existence of previous or subsequent lives. Those
Tibetans) are simply ignorant of the Sanskrit etymological meaning of lokāyata
(rgyang pan pa), and since this explanation of theirs) is not recognized by the
learned, it is of no consequence."



346
The teaching of the ways of] the warrior class (Ksatriya) as a doctrine
and other such teachings also arose based on this materialistic philosophy).
Because these materialists] deny moral causation, they are called "proponents of
annihilation." In that way those five schools of dialecticians are also grouped
together into two classes: eternalists and annihilationists.114
(III 44) The first three adhere to the Vedas. The latter two reject the
Vedas. They all agree on the existence of a self. In other particulars of
theory they are dissimilar.
114
Thus the first three of the five schools of dialecticians--the *Vaidika,
Samkhya and Aulūkya--take the Vedas to be a sound means of knowledge. Even so,
the *Vaidika and Sankhya say that the Vedas were not made, but came into being of
themselves, after which Brahma became aware of them and uttered them from his four
mouths. The Kaņādas (Vaiseșikas) hold that they were composed by Ievara. Ac-
cordingly those three philosophical systems take as their deities Brahma, Isvara,
and Vişnu.113 Nevertheless, they receive [only] the name of the god] they have
chosen as their tutelary deity: they have become known by such names as *Brahmana,
"Aisvara (Saiva), and Vaisnava, just as Buddhists who meditate on different tute-
lary deities become known by that (deity's) name.
[Question:] If all those three take the Vedas to be a sound means of
knowledge, why are they not all placed in the (single class) "Vaidika"? [Answer:]
There is some) truth in that. However, they got their respective names because
the *Vaidikas (Mimamsa-Vedānta) give the primary place to the Vedas themselves,
while the Samkhya and Kāņāda (Vaiseșika) emphasize the sages (rsis) who expounded
the Vedas. Just so, even though in general (ali] Buddhists consider the Sütras to
be an authority, only the Sautrāntikas received that name, while the other Bud-
dhist schools)--the Vaibhāşika, Mind-Only, and Madhyamaka--were named according to
other reasons. 115
All non-Buddhist sectarians agree on positing a self (atman), for the
eternalists maintain that the self is permanent, and the annihilationists hold
that the existent self is annihilated [at death). The statement) by Acārya
Asanga that however many non-Buddhist sectarian theories there are, (they) all
arise from the positing of a self was also stated with this in mind. Other
particular features of the (non-Buddhist systems of] tenets, (such as their
doctrinal formulations about moral cause and effect and about the spiritual path
and its fruit, are seen to be different.



(III 45) There are many instances of Tibetan dialecticians having confused
the arrangement of this. Therefore one should not hold as true the treatises
they have promulgated.
There indeed exist many (arrangements of) tenets that have been formulated
by some Tibetan religious scholars. But those (scholars), not having studied the
doctrinal systems of the major scriptures, have blundered by arranging dialecti-
cians of a single school separately on the basis of the mutual refutations [be-
tween the subdivisions of the school), and by arranging into a single school of
dialecticians [those of different schools) based on the reason of mere agreement
of a tenet. For example, the Srävaka and Mahāyāna, and also the Vaibhaşika,
Sauträntika, Mind-Only and Madhyamaka, even though they refute each other, are to
be included within the single grouping "Buddhist," without being separated.
[p. 135) And the same is the case with the schools of dialecticians, which are to
be kept separate because even though there may be agreement between a few tenets
of mentalistic schools, (1.e. between) some Vedāntins and the Jaina and Mind-Only
schools, or even though there may be similar terminology (such as the Mimamsa,
Lokāyata, and Madhyamaka-Prasangika's mentioning a "refutation of existent
entities," "inference recognized by others" (gzhan la grasa pali res dpag), or
"emptiness" (stong pa ayid : sünyatā), (in fact) their meanings are different.
(III 46) The Buddhists have four systems of tenets: Vaibhäşika, Sauträntika,
Vi hapti[vāda), and Nihavabhavavāda (Madhyamaka). As to their subdivisions,
several divisions of tenets exist. For a detailed [description] one
should refer to [ay] Analysis of Tenets (Grub stha' rna 'byed).
Among the scriptures of the Sugata there are two (main divisions): Sravaka
and Mahayana. The Srāvaka has two (branches]: Vaibhäşika and Sautrantika. The
Mahayana has two [branches): Mind-Only (Yogācāra) and Madhyamaka. The Mind-Only
has two [sub-schools]: Sākara ("possessing a cognitive image") and Niräkära
("without a cognitive image"). The Madhyamaka has two (sub-schools): Svätantrika
and Prasangika. 120 For [details about their subdivisions one should refer to
[ay] Analysis of Tenets (Grub mtha' rnan 'byed).
(III 47,48) If the two [debaters) affirm tenets, first they should determine
the basic subject of debate. If one debates with non-Buddhist sectarians



348
and Srävakas who maintain external objects, one should (for the moment also]
affirm external objects. If not, it will be hard to find an occasion for
debate because the basic subject of debate is not in accord. [p. 136]
What [Dharmakirti! meant was that on an occasion when two debaters are
explaining the truth or falsity of tenets for the sake of upholding their own
doctrine, if one is debating with Srāvakas of non-Buddhist sectarians who affirm
external objects as real, one should adopt the Sautrantika system. Because if
one denies (or negates] physical objects when establishing sensory cognition as
non-conceptual, etc., the debate on the immediate topic will be put off. But an
occasion for debate will be easily established if one poolts such things as the
(similar cognitive image) that is produced immediately afterward] by the force of
the object. 125
The Blessed One too affirmed external objects in the Sūtras, for as
[Dharmakirti) said in the Pramāpa-várttika (III 219):
Therefore, looking at objects) in the way that an elephant does,
(seemingly) overlooking the ultimate reality of objects, [the Buddha)
engaged in investigation of external objects, with [his) mind solely
[directed toward how) ordinary people in the world (view objects).
in order to make the intended meaning
It is traditionally said that Dharmakirti,
of that fully (plain), declared:
But when engaging in external objects, I base (myself) on the level of
the Sauträntika, 125
Having cut off the limbs of the debate which is based on external objects, for the
sake of cutting its root (Dharmakirti, PV III 360 and Pin I 51, said):12
Entities do not exist in reality because of that very [reasoning)
through which one investigates entities. This is because those ſenti
ties) do not have a single or plural nature.
[Objection:) When external entities are thus negated by the reason of the ab-
sence of oneness and manyness, 140 the logical reason of that (argument is not
established. [Reply:] The sindlar [cognitive image] that is produced (secondart-
lyl (skyes la 'dra ba of the Sautrantikas is also not established when external
objects have been negated through a proof by means of the reasoning of the



349
For as (Dharmakirti) said in the
simultaneous conjunction of six (atoms).139
passage beginning (PV III 353b-d):
Someone may ask, "How could there be the apprehension of objects by that ap-
pearance-possessing [cognition] for which there does not exist any real
entity (as its object? That is true. I too do not know how that could
be] so. 130
On this occasion the reasoning of] being devoid of oneness and manyness is a
reasoning of just the Mind-Only, while those who maintain that it is a Madhyamaka
tradition simply miss the point of this passage in the text.
[Objection:] Granted that this appearance (of an external world] was not
created by Isvara. [But] if one negates atoms, it will be the case that [this
appearance) arises without a cause. [Reply:) There is no (auch]
inconsistency, because as it is said in the Dasabhüntka Sutra:
O sons of the Conqueror, these three world-realms are merely mind.
And as it is said in the Lankavatāra Sutra:
The mind which is agitated by latent propensities evolves into the
appearance as objects.
There are no objects. It is just the mind. The seeing of external
objects is erroneous. 134
If one establishes the sense of those statements by means of reasoning, one
refutes [the contention that the objective part (of perception] 18 a separate
external object by means of such [reasoning) as the necessary concomitance of
simultaneous apprehension. 15
[Doubt :) Because one has thus negated external objects, the mental]
appearing (of things) as apprehended [objects] is not acceptable. (Reply:) By
negating the apprehended [1.e. the "objective") part [of perception), the very
[subject] that apprehends it is also negated. [p. 138] For as (Vasubandhu) said:
Because there
is no apprehended [object), for that there exists no
apprehender, 136
Therefore pure experience is established by self-referential awareness. By
refuting apprehended [object) and apprehending subject) through reasoning that



350
non-dual awareness is established.
For as [Dharma-
has objective grounding,
kārti) said (in PVin I 38]:
The mind has no other thing to experience. For it, there exists no
other experiencer. Because apprehended [object) and apprehending (sub-
ject] do not exist, (the mind] thus 11luminates itself. 30
Therefore (Dharmakirti's) intended meaning was that this very (non-dual awareness)
18 the basis of Cyclic Existence (sapsāra) and Extinction (nirvana) which arise
from being mistaken or not, through the power of understanding or not under
standing.
Therefore, having established "mental cognition" (vijftapti)the basis for
transactional usage, (now) for the sake of establishing the ultimate truth that is
beyond transactional usage (ve consider the following): In the Lankavatara
Sūtra it is said:
And having gone beyond "mind-only," one should apply oneself) to that
which is without appearance. 140
And in the Pramāpavirttika (II 252cd, 253ab) (Dharmakirti) said:
[The Buddha) taught the meditation on suffering with the suffering of
conditionality in mind. [According to our (school), that (suffering)
was born from the conditions of the klesas). That (production through
conditions) too is a support for the theory of no-self. 41
And in the Yuktişastika [v. 12, Nagarjuna) said:
That unwise man who Imagines the birth of even an extremely subtle
entity [p. 139] does not perceive the sense of birth out of
conditions. 142
Therefore non-dual awareness itself is dependent, momentary, and born from condi-
tions. And since birth from conditions itself is the absence of (genuine,
Independent) birth, [only] that which is birthless and free from discursive de-
velopments is established in ultimate truth. For as it is said in the Anavatapta-
nagarā tapariprccha Sutra:



351
Anything born from conditions is not born. For it there does not exist
a nature that is born. That which is dependent on conditions is
emptiness. He who understands emptiness is prudent.
Therefore, if one well understands "mental cognition" (vi főaptt), one vill under-
stand the undistorted reality of the Madhyamaka.149 That was the intended meaning
of the author of the Pramanavārtika, 145
(III 49) When one discerns external objects, the Sautrantika tenets have
obtective grounding.146 Therefore all the basic treatises of all [great)
scholars possess such (tenets as their basis).
When one engages in [investigations wherein one provisionally accepts)
external objects, what the non-Buddhist sectarians maintain--cognition of a sense
object through a connection of inherence (samsvāya) [i.e. of a quality in the
object which comes in contact with the sense organ) --and what the Vaibhāşikas
maintain--cognition of the object through simultaneous object and sense
faculty--are not acceptable, for there exists a sound means of knowledge that
disproves them. [But) there does exist proof and there is no disproof of the
opinion maintained by the Sautrintikas that there is birth of cognition from four
conditions, such as the object, sense faculty, and attention, which is the
import of the statement in a Sutra: "Based on the eye, taking form as its object,
ocular cognition is born."149 [p. 140] Consequently this is a sound means of
knowledge that possesses objective grounding. Therefore this is the reason that
all Igreat) scholars such as the Acārya Asanga and his brother [Vasubandhu),
Dignāga, and Dharmakirti composed their doctrinal formulations of scripture and
reasoning based on the Sautrāntika.
(III 50) In this regard, [certain) Tibetans proclaim that some followers
of the Mind-Only asserted external objects. [But] just like a permanent
entity, this is impossible. [Those who assert external objects are
simply to be included within the Sauträntika.
[Certain) Tibetans maintain that those texts which affirm both external
objects and mind--the treatises of the higher [1.e. Mahayana) Abhidharm such as
the Abhidharmasamuccaya--are Mind-Only [texts) that assert external objects.
[This) 18 unacceptable, for if the theory) is mind-only (T4b.: sens teams



cittamatra) it is incompatible with the affirmation of external objects, and it
one affirms external objects that is incompatible with the Mind-Only. It is, for
example, just like affirming a permanent entity. For if something] is permanent,
it is not possible that it be an object, (and) if (something) is an entity it is
not possible that it be permanent. Therefore [here) it is simply the case that by
virtue of their not knowing well the Sautrantika tenets, (such persons) rashly
speak of "followers of the Mind-Only who have affirmed external objects."
(III 51) When external objects are being 'negated,"mental cognition" (vi-
japti) is objectively grounded. When reality is being determined. [p. 141)
the reasons of the Madhyamaka are objectively grounded.
Therefore, at the time when external objects are being negated, [the rea-
sons) of the Mind-Only (such as] "the absence of oneness and manyness," "the
necessary concomitance of simultaneous apprehension," and "the reason of (11-
lumination and awareness, as well as reasons based on scripture such as the
different appearances of a single object to beings of different karmaa), all have
objective grounding.
But when ultimate reality is being determined, the reasoning of the Sva-
tantrika-Madhyamaka such as the "vajra-particle" (rdo rje szege ma) and the "nega-
tion of the 'tetralemma' (catuskoti) of birth" (mu baht skye 'gog) and the
reasonings of the Prāsangika such as the "[unestablished) like the thing to be
proven" (sadhyasana) and the "(analogous reasoning through) a like reason"
("hetusana have objective grounding. 15
(III 52) Some say that 1f one affirms tenets, there exists no objective
grounding. That is not so. If there were no objective grounding, how would
the negating and establishing of (anything by] reasoning be feasible?
Sone Tibetans say that when one bases oneself on tenets one merely utters
ignorant and capricious fabrications through the desire and hatred that arises
from] maintaining one's own opinion, and that tenets based on scripture have no
objective grounding. This is not acceptable. [To say so) is to detract from
the Lord Buddha, saintly individuals and learned persons, because tenets based on
scripture follow them. Therefore, if tenets have no objective grounding coming
into play in their respective contexts, there will be no capability of negating or
establishing (anything with respect to that context. For example, for



353
individuals of similar experience of appearances (according to their karma 16
such things as water and fire appear, just that sound cognition by direct percep-
tion of their characteristics of quenching or burning has objective grounding.
But for others whose karnas do not agree, such as for hungry ghosts (pretas), [p.
142) such things as water do not have objective grounding. [For them) what is
objectively grounded is just whatever they experience themselves.
Accordingly, if one affirms [the existence of] entities, the proof that
entities are impermanent through [the reason) that they are fabricated (or]
existent has objective grounding. But how could the proof that an entity) is
manent because it is fabricated [or] existent have objective grounding for a
Madhyamika? [The Madhyamika] does not affirm either existence or non-existence as
the characteristic of a subject) whose "entityness" is not established, because
all factors of existence (dharnas) are without own-natures. For as it is said
in the Mother (i.e. the Pra fāpāramita):
O Sariputra, where there does not exist mind, is there anything to be
objectively apprehended as something like existent or non-existent?
And as it is said in the Prajñaparamita Ratnagupasapcayagātha (V 1c):
[If a Bodhisattva) expounds impermanence, [he] deals with the counter-
feit, 165
Likewise the reasons that are based on causality and non-apprehension too
will have a different objective grounding according to different experienced
appearances (of external reality) and (different] tenets.
Moreover, though for ordinary beings of mundane vision the five sense
organs engaging their own separate objects has objective grounding, for a Buddha
who has transcendental vision the five sense organs engage all objects. [At that
time) the very thing described in the Mahāyānasūtrālapkāra [IX 41] is objectively
grounded:
When the five sense organs are transformed [through the attainment of
Buddhahood, they] engage all objects, and there arise the twelve-
hundred good qualities for all the senses). One attains the excellent
wealth of the two kivas). 168
Therefore since the objective grounding is different according to dif-
ferences between [various beings') karna and [between) individuals, you should



354
discern (in every context] what is and is not objectively grounded
[Doubt:) The system of the surface-level and (p. 143) ultimate truth are
different, and therefore while the ultimate is beyond knowledge and expression
because it is free from discursive developments, negation and proof that are
objectively grounded (can) operate [only] with regard to the surface-level [of
truth) since (the latter) is the object of knowledge and expression. Answer:]
That being so, the stages of non-Buddhist sectarian and Buddhist tenets come into
play concerning the acceptability or non-acceptability of just the surface level,
[including) such [topics) as the existent and non-existent, the permanent and non-
permanent, insensible material things and mind, and apprehended object and appre-
hending subject. And regarding those [different stages of tenets), 1f the non-
Buddhist sectarian affirms a self that partakes of objects, for him there is
nothing suitable besides that reasoning of his. And accordingly the intended
meaning [of Dharmakirti?] was that the positions maintained by the Buddhist
schools)--the Vaibhaşika's "apprehension through simultaneously [occuringl sense
organ and object," the Sautrântika's "production of cognition that apprehends
objects through four conditions," the Mind-Only adherent's "pure experience
[that is) non-dual cognition, which appears as external [objects) because of
habitual propensities," and the Madhyamika's "appearance of interdependent
[arising for that which lacks an own-nature, "-[are objectively grounded each in
their own contexts). In the affirming of one's own system, that very reasoning of
one's own situation--that very reasoning which is immediately appropriate with
reference to that context-is [held to be] objectively grounded, for to reason in
a way that is mixed up with other contexts or systems) is to wander in error.
For example, in activities such as farming in different places and seasons,
(each activity) will be successfully realized through its own system of practice,
whereas if one mixes them up one will not succeed." The Buddha's teaching of
different classes of scripture according to the particular mental dispositions (of
different creatures] was also done with that in mind.
(Objection:) Even though one should stay within the reasoning of the
context of one's own (school), still, whatever becomes destroyed when examined by
scholars is mistaken, while whatever [remains) undestroyed 1s objectively
grounded. [Reply:] In that case, (p. 144] reasoning that is objectively grounded
would be impossible to express. For whatever is established as the object of mind
becomes, upon examination, liable to faults. Nothing is (then) suitable but
silence. For as it is said in the Sūtra of the Licchavi (i.e. the Vinalakirtintr-
desa):
The Son of the Conqueror remains in silence. Silence itself explains
Breatly 173



355
And in the Pramāpavārttika LIII 209):
"However one examines [objects), just so [do they] disintegrate." That
[reasoning) stated by learned persons issues from objective
grounding. 174
Therefore since nothing whatsoever is established if examined by reasoning that is
objectively grounded, ultimately one should adopt the behavior of [Vimalakirti)
the Licchavi.
(III 53) And with regard to reasoning there are two types. The tradition of
the other group, the non-Buddhist sectarians (is that there are one or many
means of knowledge, and [they maintain) separate definitions for those and
many differences in (their) divisions and classifications. But since these
are well known as being erroneous, here I shall not explain them.
Also with regard to the system of reasoning, there are two: our own
group--the Buddhists-and the other group--the non-Buddhist Indian sectarians.
From among those two, the early Buddhists maintained that there were three means
of knowledget direct perception, inference, and scripture; whereas Dignaga held
that scripture that is incompatible with reasoning is not a true means of know-
ledge, and that if scripture is not falsified by reasoning and (p. 145] is not
mutually contradictory. It is a means of knowledge, though it should be included
within inference." For as [Dharmakirti) said in the Pramanavärttika (1 216):
Even though the object of trustworthy words (of scripture) is hidden
from the general [classes of manifest and hidden phenomena cognizable
by the infallible (means of knowledge), because there is no opportuni-
ty [to cognize a "completely hidden" phenomena otherwise), the cogni-
tion [that understands through scriptures) is held to be the means of
knowledge, inference.176
The non-Buddhist sectarians maintain that there are one, three, four, five,
six or more sound means of knowledge." But since these (opinions) are univer-
sally known to be erroneous, here I have not elaborated on them.



356
(III 54) Our own faction holds the Buddha to be an authority. That (tradi-
tion of logico-epistemology) has two (schools), an early and a later. The
early (school), which included such (scholars] as Vasubandhu and Bhava
viveka, though in fact being without error, was nevertheless different
[from the later school] with respect to some differences of division and
classification, and in its manner of expressing (a formally stated inference).
Those early scholars in actual fact were without error. Nevertheless there
exist differences with the later logicians) regarding the number of sound means
of knowledge, their internal divisions and classifications, and the form of ex-
pression of the formal argument]. They maintained a system in which three means
of knowledge were held to exist : direct perception, inference, and scripture.
And Vasubandhu ia his Vädavidhi (Rtsod pa grub pa) classified futile rejoinders
into three (classes].961 Also the early logicians) employed a five-tenbered
statement of proof.182 [p. 146]
(III 55) The later [Buddhist logicians) such as Dignāga and Dharmakirti
were superior to the early school with respect to such things as the number
[of sound means of knowledge), differences of divisions and classifications,
and the "expansiveness in brevity" regarding the form in which their formal
argument] was expressed.
The later scholars such as Dignāga determined that the sound means of
knowledge were two in number; scripture [for them] is not a means of knowledge 1
1t conflicts with reasoning, and if it does not conflict (with reasoning it
[should be] included within inference. And as for the differences of divisions
and classifications, such logical relations (sambandha) as cause and effect
(karya-karapa) were included within [the two): identity (tadătaya) and causation
(tadutpatti). They did not classify futile rejoinders into three classes, for
as the sutra (1.e. the Pramapasamuccaya) says:
In the Vädavidhi [of Vasubandhu] three types [of futile rejoinders) are
explained with reference to the futile rejoinders [taught by the non-
Buddhist dialecticians): inverted, untrue, and contrary. Regarding
this, one cannot differentiate [them in this way 1.100
Also, the method by which (the early logicians] set forth (their) argument had
five members. To give an example:



357
(1) There exists a fire on the pass [Thesis]
(2) for there exists smoke, [Reason]
(3) as in a kitchen. (Example)
(4) Smoke exists also on the pass. (Application)
(5) Therefore fire exists (on the pass). [Conclusion]
This is unacceptable, because the expression of pervasion (wyäpti) of the reason
by the predicate oo (1.e. "wherever there is smoke there is fire"] is not con
plete, and the thesis (pratijña), application (upanava) and conclusion (nigamana)
are redundant. Therefore (their) statements of argument were "expansive in
brevity."190 which means that because they formulated [their argumentation in a
two-membered for the expression of the pervasion of the reason by the predicate
and the statement of the presence of the reason in the subject (paksa-
dharmata)"!--the dialectic of the later (logicians) was supreme.
And regarding the later persons who based themselves on the basic texts of
Dharmakirti:
(III 56) I have seen two debating procedures. [p. 147] Dharmakirti "re-
moved the thorns" from the reason after having set forth his statement of
proof. He held that to do] otherwise was a defeat situation.
As [Dharmakirti] said in his Vādanyāya," after one has set forth a fault-
less statement of proof for whatever the present context of debate is, one should
"remove the thorna"** [i.e. show the absence of a fallacious reason by stating]
as follows:
This logical mark is not unestablished (asiddha) for it is seen in the
subject.
It is not contrary (viruddha), for it is established in homogeneous
instances.
It is not uncertain (anaikantika), for it is absent from heterogeneous
instances.
A proponent who does not remove the three thorns through such a procedure is in a
defeat situation. After the fallacies of the reason have been negated, the
respondent's statement of rebuttal should begin, he taught."
(III 57) Some later scholars of reasoning in their statements of the logical
reason during debate] "removed the thorns" (1.e. negated the fallacies of



358
the reason) [only] after the respondent had stated the logical fault.
Tibetans debate in general in agreement with that [method).
It is related that a debate once took place between a scholar of Vikrama-
bila and an Eastern Indian (Bangala) Brahmin, in which a king who knew grammar and
tnessing arbiter. At that time the opinion maintained by the
Brahmin was that the sound of the Veda was permanent, and in that connection the
Buddhist advanced the thesis that it was impermanent. The Brahmin inquired, "For
what reason is it not permanent?" (In reply] the Buddhist set forth the statement
of proof: "Whatever exists is non-permanent, as a pot. Sound too exists." To
that the Brahmin remarked in criticism, "The 'thorns of that logical mark have
not been removed." Since the king was witness, the latter said to the Buddhist,
"Remove the thorns of that logical mark!" (p. 148] The [Buddhist) pandita
answered, "What is the need to remove the thorns of my logical mark which is
without fault?" At that the Brahmin, since he did not know the reason for the
need to remove the thorns, sat there (silently), having lost the confidence to
reply. Since then most proponents have adhered to that procedure, and many prac-
tice a system (of debate) that includes such things as not removing the thorns
regarding the logical mark.
I have seen that the debating (practice] of Tibetan dialecticians, who do
not know the system of the Vádanyāya, is also always to engage in the respondent's
statement of faults without the proponent] having removed the thorns with regard
to the logical mark.
(III 58) Since this procedure is not what was maintained by Dharmakirti, it
is difficult for it to be acceptable.
Since [Dharmakirti] taught in the Vādanyaya that it is an occasion of
defeat for the proponent if he does not remove the thorns with respect to the
statement of the logical mark (in his formal argument], one should debate
having removed the thorns. If one does) otherwise, it will be contrary to the
intent of Dharmakirti.
(III 59) One should understand this sort of debating from the "Group of
Seven" (treatises by Dharmakirti] and from the Treasure of Reasoning (Rigs
pa'i gter).



359
[This method of debating) is taught at great length in the Pramäpavärttika
and the others of the "Group of Seven" (Pramāņa] treatises [by Dharmakirtt), and
one should (also) understand this from the Treasure of Reasoning (Rigs pa'i gter)
of my own composition, which summarizes the import of the "Group of Seven."
is
(III 60) Here I shall explain a little of the system (of debatel which
easily understandable for beginners.
On this occasion I shall explain a little of the way of questioning and
answering, in order to make it easily understood by beginners at debating.
[p. 149]
(III 61) If one questions, one should ask something that is pertinent to the
topic. [One should not [ask] simultaneously a large number [of questions).
The non-Buddhist sectarians say that after the proponent recites in a
single continuous statement a [long] series of different purvapaksas such as one
hundred or two hundred of them, the respondent [should] repeat that [long series
of] purvapaksas without mixing up their order. Then [the respondent) should
refute [that] ordered series by means of [his) uttarapakşas. But if [the respon-
dent] is unable to state such (a long series of purvapakşas, there will occur the
defeat situation called "not repeating." The intended meaning of Dharmakirti)
in the Vādanyāya is that although it is permissible to refute each pūrvapaksa that
1s immediately relevant to the topic, to repeat irrelevant pürvapaksas would be a
defeat by the very fact that to do sol is not a "branch" [1.e. a statement of
proof or refutation. U Therefore even when the respondent questions, he should
ask about a relevant topic of debate such as "Is sound permanent or non-perna-
nent?" But he should not ask many [questions such as "Is it self-produced?" "Is
it made by a person?" (and so forth), for to debate about a latter question
without determining the previous would make one's statement faulty.
[Objection:) Some non-Buddhist sectarians say that after the proponent]
has strung together many purvapaksas, the respondent, not being able to retain
those exactly, will become mixed up and make mistakes when [attempting to repeat
and refute them in the order [that they were recited by the proponent). And in
that way [they hold that the enumerating of many purvapak as is a means for
causing the occurence of the defeat situation called "lacking the confident compo-
sure of mind [to reply)..203



360
[Reply:] [Dharmakirti] in the Vådan yāya said that even if one defeats
[others] by means of trickery, this does not enable one to uphold tenets.
Therefore it is not to be considered] the debate of a noble person.
(III 62) Even though many logical marks apply to one probandum [p. 150), in
debate one should not [state] many. If the previous one is not a sound)
logical mark, that is a defeat situation. If it is ſa sound] logical mark,
[then to state] the latter brings about a defeat situation.
For demonstrating that sound is impermanent there exist many logical marks
that are probans, such as that sound is] an existing entity, that it is fabri-
cated, and that it is the outcome of effort. But one should state only one [of
those) and should not state many others. For (when one states more than one
reason), if the earlier (reason] is not a [sound] logical mark there will be a
defeat occasion through stating something that is not a probans. Whereas if the
former (reason) is a [sound] logical mark, there is a defeat situation [because]
the statement of the latter [reason) is a redundancy, just as a statement of the
thesis is redundant and unnecessary in Dignāga and Dharmakirti's system].200
(III 63) [In some cases where the respondent says) such things as that the
subject is not established, if [the proponent] questions the reason, it [may]
be revealed as established.
[A respondent) may say, "The subject is not established," when one (as
the proponent posits) as one's subject an impossible subject such as the horn of a
hare or the self (atman"; or posits a subject that, though possible, is not
established by a sound means of knowledge, such as a demon's pot or the freedom
from desire"; or when a subject such as a mental direct perception or an inde-
pendent), non-contingent [entity] [is asserted) which, though established through
a means of knowledge, threatens to spoil the basic topic of debate 16 one states, a
probans. In that case, one should speak (in reply) as follows: "Is its being
unestablished merely words, or is there a reason for it? If it is unestablished
merely on account of your words, then why is it not established by means of
I just my words if] I too say, 'It is established'?" If [the respondent] says,
"There exists a logical mark" (then one should reply), "Set forth that logical
mark." If he sets forth a logical mark, and if he does not set forth as [his]
subject such [unestablished] things as the horn of a hare or a demon's pot, the



subject will be unestablished for the respondent too. But if [the respondent]
does set forth (such unestablished things as his subject), that itself will be the
established subject of the proponent too. Likewise (p. 151] one should fittingly
apply and understand (this principle] in relation to other debates.
(III 64) The master [Nagarjuna) maintained that when Madhyamikas debate by
means of emptiness, all the replies of others are unestablished like the
things to be proven. 211
When a Madhyamika (in a debate) against those who maintain the existence of
entities negates such things as Isvara [the creator), insensate material objects,
or Vijñapti by means of such reasoning as the absence of production, at that time
[in] all those proofs)--the proof by the *Aisvara (Saiva) of the existence of]
the creator Tavara by the putting forward of such things as shapes [found in
nature], and in the putting forward of] "atoms" by the Sravaka and the posi-
ting of a probans for the existence of] Vijñapti by the Mind-Only adherents-
the probans is also unestablished just as the probandum is established. Even
though they set forth something else for the sake of proving that (probandum of
theirs), it is similar to that. For as the master [Nägar juna) said in the
Mulamadhyamaka karikās IV 8]:
If one argues through emptiness, whoever claims to give a reply has not
replied at all, for [his probans) is like the thing to be proven.
Likewise one should apply and understand [this principle) with regard to such
[Prasangika rensonings) as the "balancing through a like reason" (rayu mtshan
at shunga pa'i mgo anyoma).215
(III 65) Tibetans have three answers to [rejoinders given by the respondent
in the form of] necessary consequences: they answer that the reason or the
pervasion is unestablished, or else that they are agreed in maintaining (the
consequence).
Tibetans have three answers to necessary consequences (in which the respon-
dent attempts to refute the proponent's formal statement of proof): If the reason
is absent from the subject, (p. 152] (they answer), "The reason is unestablished."
To both contrary and uncertain (reasons they answer). "The pervasion is



362
unestablished." If [the consequence] is in accord with what they affirm, they
answer "Agreed..216
(III 66) In that case all logical defects of necessary consequences should
be (reduced to] "It is unestablished" alone. But this was not taught in
the "Group of Seven treatises of Dharmakirti)."
Why not say "It is unestablished" to all faulty reasons? (Objection)
Although in fact they are all subsumed within "not established," still the non-
establishment of the reason is a fault regarding the absence of the reason from
the subject, and the non-establishment of pervasion is a defect of pervasion.
Consequently there should be the two: unestablished reason and unestablished
pervasion. [Reply:] In such a case, though the contrary and uncertain (reasons)
are both defects of pervasion, the contrary is where the reason) has no occurence
whatsoever in homogeneous instances, and the uncertain is where [the reason]
occurs also in heterogeneous instances. So why should there not be tvo [kinds of]
necessary consequences, called "contrary" and "uncertain"?
Therefore, if one subsumes the answers under "unestablished," all the
replies will be one and the same, whereas if one divides them with a purpose in
view, there will be three [replies that indicate logical faults). For that reason
[Dharmakārti) in the "Group of Seven (Treatises]" on the occasion of explaining)
debating taught three logical defects: "unestablished," "contrary," and "uncer-
tain." But he did not make "the pervasion is unestablished" into one class. For
as it was said (in PV I 15):
And with regard to the three modes of the reason, he stated the neces-
sity that these three must act] as the counteragents to [reasons that
are) unestablished, of opposite content (1.e. "contrary"), and erro-
neous [1.e. "uncertain").218 [p. 153]
(III 67) [In answer to the statement of contrary consequence, [if the
proponent says) "What does it matter if [the opposite of the original predi-
cate) is the case even if [the reason) exists?" the force of the conjunctive
particle (yang) goes awry.
[In answer) to statements of incompatible consequences such as "Because it
is fabricated it follows that it is permanent" or "Because smoke exists it



363
follows that there is no fire," (in your tradition you) must say, "What is the
incompatibility f (something] is non-permanent even if it is fabricated? The
pervasion is not established." Or: "What is the incompatibility if there exista
fire even 16 smoke also exists? The pervasion is not established." But in those
cases, because the word kyang (here: "even if") is a particle which causes con-
Junction, [the sense becomes): "Even if 'fabricated' applies to both permanent and
non-permanent, here it is non-permanent." Or: "Even if 'smoke' applies to both
the existence and non-existence of fire, here what is the incompatibility if it is
smoke which has a fire?" [The particle kyang) will be a particle of conjunction
[giving the sense): "There is the consequence of smoke even in the absence of
fire." Just as in the following example: When the respondent) states, "Because
(sound) is an object of knowledge, it follows that it is permanent," [in your
tradition you must state (in reply]: "What is the incompatibility if it is non-
permanent even 1f it is also an object of knowledge?" But in that case the word
yang acts as a particle that joins both "permanent" and "non-permanent" to "object
of knowledge."
Therefore all such modes of expression are manifestations of not identi-
fying the force of the words because of not understanding grammar.
[Question:) How do you reply to necessary consequences? [Answer:]
(III 68) For this there are the three (replies to faulty consequences):
"unestablished," "contrary," and "uncertain." If it is none (of these three,
the reply is): "What I maintain is established" [i.e. "Agreed"). If it is
none of those [four), it cannot be confuted because it is a sound logical
consequence.220 [p. 154]
We maintain as follows]: If (a respondent) says [to a proponent who
maintains that sound is impermanent because it is fabricated]: "(It follows that)
sound [is permanent, or anything else] because it is an object of sense-apprehen-
sion for the eye," (the proponent's reply is): "The reason is unestablished in
the subject)." Or if [the respondent) says: "It follows that fire does not exist
because there is smoke," (the reply is]: "[The reason) is contrary." And if (the
respondent) says, "It follows that (sound) is permanent because it is an object of
knowledge," (the reply 1s): "[The reason) is uncertain." And if the respondent)
says, "It follows that (sound) is not permanent because it has been fabricated,"
[the proponent's reply 1s): "I maintain that."
And if to [a proponent] who maintains that fabricated things are permanent
[the respondent) states, "It follows that (sound) is permanent because it is



364
fabricated," he cannot confute this because it is valid (as a consequence of his
position 1.221
(III 69) Debating that thus conforms with the Dharma is a cause for the
Doctrine to flourish. Since it is praised by the Noble Ones, learned persons
should excellently compose (such discourses).24
Proof and refutation that are achieved) without faults of sense or
Language for the sake of correct understanding of the Doctrine are a cause for the
Doctrine to flourish. Therefore noble individuals should produce such religious
discourses.
III. The Conclusion:
The Summary and Communication [of What Transpired]
for the sake of Making it Easily Understandable to the Assembly
(III 70) Having thus properly settled [the debate). (finally) for the sake
of making the contents of the debate] retained, the witness should summarize
and proclaim the statements made in the debate. This is the traditional
practice of [great) scholars.
After the matters to be proved or negated have been established by way of
assertions and replies in the actual debate, and after the acceptance and rejec-
tion of tenets have thereby been made understood, [the witnessing arbiter) should
bring together any statements that have become a bit dispersed, and state them so
that the assembly can easily understand.22 (p. 155]
(III 71) If the assembled (witnesses) are ignorant, or if through attach-
ment or anger they do not take heed, one should in that place write down the
words [of the arguments) and (afterward] show them to another learned, up-
right (Judge). 224
If the witness is an ignorant person who is unlearned in the procedures of
debate, or if even though he understands he does not pay attention on account of
desire or anger, or 1 he falsely detracts (something from one's honestly stated



vords, or falsely imputes something by slightly changing the wording--where such
vitnesses are found, the debating of [true] scholars will not be praised, just as
in a place where there is a poisonous snake, a lamp will not be bright. Therefore
in that place with the witness present, one should set down in writing the words
[of both opponents), and by sending [this record] to the gathering of another
assembly of upright scholars, the learned virtues [of the two debaters) will be
exactly understood. This procedure is the liberated conduct (followed by the
great scholars of the past.
(III 72) By sounding forth the lion's roar of the Doctrine of the Tatha-
gata, may I defeat all the wild animals of erroneous views, and dwelling in
the incontrovertible attainment, may I continually uphold the doctrine of
the Buddha: 225



366
[Concluding Verses and Colophon]
(III 73) So that the Sage's Doctrine may widely flourish and so that it may
remain for a long time in this world, I have opened the three entrance doors
for the wise who uphold the traditions of scholarship. May the wise enter
vithin!226 [p. 156]
(III 74) The sentient creatures of this degenerate age possess little
merit. For that reason they lack the capacity to [be able to study [to the
point of mastery. Even though I exert myself, there are few who take it up.
227
Therefore it is difficult for me to find] a chance for benefiting others.
(III 75) Though indeed I have still more excellent sayings (to impart),
these are not within the range of the beings of this corrupt age. Because
persons who desire learnedness are few, I have not expatiated here at great
length, for there is little it will do.426
(III 76) (I), the Säkya bhikṣu Kundgal-rgyal-mtshan-dpal-bzang-po who have
great reverence toward the Doctrine here at the termination of the Doc-
trines and who wish to defend and uphold the entire Doctrine, have com-
posed this for the benefit of the Doctrine. 230
(III 77) Nowadays this doctrine of the Sakya Lion diminishes day by day,
11ke a pond whose tributary streams have dried up.21 Those who have bright
minds [and] who desire liberation must exert themselves for an excellent
understanding of this procedure. 232
(III 78) By the opening of [this] Entrance Gate for the Wise, which I have
here composed so that the Doctrine may flourish, may all beings enter the
gateway of the great liberation, and may the Conqueror together with his sons
be pleased! 233
This treatise, the Entrance Gate for the Wise, which establishes the procedures of
composition, teaching and debate, is a gateway by which intelligent persons enter
Into the great city of liberation; it is a passageway to be crossed over by noble
persons. [p. 157] It was composed in a country of the northern region, the Land
of Glacier-peaked Mountains, a place situated one hundred yojanas from the



367
Bodhinanda of the Vajrasana (Bodhgaya), by the Šakya bhiku Kun-dgat-rgyal-atshan-
dpal-bzang-po, whose mental darkness was removed to a small extent by light rays
from the mind of Mañjughoga and who thereby attained mental illumination over most
of the Mandala of knowable things and thus has the merit of possessing a ready
confidence concerning teaching, composition and debate.
[Here] for the present
[this treatise]
is completed.

the location of each discussion, see below, note 16.
These twenty-two occasions of defeat in debate are taught in the Nyaya
Sutras (NS) ascribed to Aksapada or Gautama, V.2, 1-23. G. Oberhammer (1963), PP.



102t, has suggested that the fifth and first books had their origin in an early
vada doctrine which was later rearranged and turned into a vāda manual, to which
book II and later books III and IV were added. See also G. Tucci (1929), PP.
468ff, and also G. Oberhammer (1964) as cited by K. Potter (1977), pp. 221 and
694.
There exist many editions and translations of the NS into European and
Indian languages (listed in K. Potter (1970), nos. 214A-276B). See especially the
edition and English translation of Ganganatha Jha, Poona Orientalist, vol. 1-10
(1936-45), which also includes Vätsyāyana's Bhäsya. The edition and translation
were reprinted as Poona Oriental Series 58 (1939) and 59 (1939), respectively. A
translation by Jha originally appeared in the Indian Thought Series 7 (1915), 9
(1917), 12 (1919), and 13 (1919), and it was reprinted in the Rinsen Sanskrit
Series II (1983), nos. 1-4.
On these NS occasions of defeat see S. C. Vidyabhusana (1921), pp. 84-90;
G. Tucci (1929), pp. 4686; Th. Stcher batsky (1930-32), vol. 1, pp. 340f; G. Jha
tr. (1939), pp. 540-554; E. A. Solomon (1976), pp. 209-261; and K. Potter (1977).

Yogacarabhūmi, see G. Tucci (1929), pp. 458-460, and A. Wayman (1958), pp. 35-37.
For the similar Vadanigrahas in the AS, see W. Rahula (1971), p. 183.
Dharmakirti discussed these defeat situations in his V. According to
the edition of D. Shastri (1972), the defeats are discussed in the following
places:

(2) prati fantaram (75.9-77.11)

The identical verses--which are thus probably the origin of KhJ verses
III 4-7-are found in the RTRG, PP. 252.4.5-253.1.1. Sa-pan's autocommentary runs
from pp. 253.1.1-257.1.1:
(1) dam bca' la gnod (253.1.2-5)
(2) dam bca' gzhan (253.1.5-2.4)

Shakya-mchog-Idan, Mkhas ug dris lan, pp. 119€, mentioned Sa-pap's treat-
ment of the defeats as one of the main "original" contributions in the Khu. But
the RT was apparently composed first (c. 1219?), and the KhJ only sometime after-
ward (c. 1220-1230?). Thus this "original" contribution had probably already been



373
made in the RT.
*These futile rejoinders (Itag chod : jāti) were taught by Gautams in the
Nyaya Sutras, V.1. See G. Jha tr. (1939b), pp. 502-535. They are also listed or
discussed by S. C. Vidyabhusana (1921), pp. 288f; S. Dasgupta (1952), vol. 2, P.
380, note 4, and E. A. Solomon (1976), pp. 144-199. K. H. Potter (1977), pp. 268-
272, gives each of the twenty-four futile rejoinders, preceded by the arguments
they purport to answer and followed by an explanation of how to "solve" such
sophistical argumentation, in connection with Vätsyāyana's Nyayabhagya.
These twenty-four are (see G. Jha (1939b) and S. C. Vidyabhusana (1921]):
(1) sadharaya-sama-jāti [RT 7]
(2) valdharmya--
[RT 8]

There is no anupalabdhi (NS no. 21) in the RT account (the Tibetan equivalent
would be ml. dmise pa). Also in the NS list there is nothing that corresponds in
name to RT no. 2, stan tshiga Chetu---), though it should be identified with NS
no. 16, ahetus,



374
Sa-pan in his RTRG explains the futile rejoinders in the following order,
based on the PS and Nyayapariksa. Sa-pan counts the first two as one, as he
explains on p. 257.1.4.
(1A) phrad pa mtshunga pa'i ltag chod [NS 9)
(257.2.1-2)
(13) ma phrad pa (257.2.1-2)
[NS 10]
(2) atan tshigs (257.2.2-5)
[NS 167]
(3) rtag pa (257.2.5-3.1)
[NS 23)
(4) ma smras pa (257.3.1-3)
(5) ma skyes pa (257.3.3-5)

(6) 'bras bu (257.3.5-4.3)
[NS 24]
(7) chos mthun pa (257.4.3-5)

(8) chos mi mthun (257.4.5-258.1.1)
[NS 2]
(9) rnam rtog (258.1.2-4)
[NS 7]
(10) khyad par med pa (258.1.4-2.3)
[NS 18]
(11) dnigs pa (258.2.3-3.2)
(12) the tshom (258.3.2-5)
[NS 14]
(13) don gyis go ba (258.3.5-4.2) [NS 17]
(14) thal 'gyur (258.4.3-5)
[NS 11]
(15) 'phel ba (259.1.3-4)
[NS 3]
(16) 'grib pa (259.1.4)
[NS 4]
(17) br jod pa (259.1.4-5)
[NS 5]
(18) ma br fod pa (259.1.5)
[NS 61
(19) rigs pa (259.1.5-6)
[NS 191
(20) so so'i dpe (259.1.6)
[NS 12]
(21) bsgrub bya (259.2.1-2)
[NS 8]
(22) si rtag pa (259.2.2-3)
[NS 22]
(23) rab byed (259.2.3-6)
[NS 15)
(24) dus las "das pa (259.2.6-3.4)
In the NS list of jātis there is nothing that corresponds to no. 4 (ma
smras pa : *anukta--?) and no. 24 (dus las "das pa : kilitita) of the RTRG. The
latter, kalatita, however, is discussed as a fallacious reason (het vabhasa: stan
tshigs Itar snang) in NS 1,2,9. It is a reason that is "mistimed." See G. Jha
tr. (19396), pp. 85-97; S. C. Vidyabhusana (1921), PP. 63-65; and K. Potter
(1977), p. 247.
Sa-pan explained the latter as a jāti because the Nalyayikas are said to
have used it as a futile rejoinder to their Mimamsaka opponents (see RTRG, P.
259.2.6). He says that this was employed by later Naiyayikas such as Vätsyayana.
For the Buddhist debator, however, this was not a "mist imed" reason. Rather, the



375
reason is simply unestablished (asiddha : ma grub pa).
See Dignaga's Pramāſasamuccaya (Tshad ma kun las btus pa, D 4206), chap-
ter 6. ltag chod brtar pa'i le'u, PS (P), pp. 122.1-120.6. The fatis mentioned
there are as follows:
(1) phrad / ma phrad
(2) stan tshigs ma tshang mtshungs
(3) rtag pa
(4) ma br fod mtshungs
(5) ma skyes mtshungs
(6) 'bras mtshungs
(7) chos mthun mtshunga
(8) chos mt mthun pas mtshungs
(9) rnam rtog mtshungs
(10) khyad med pa
(11) dmiga pa mtshungs
(12) the tshom
(13) don toga
(14) thal ba mtshungs
Sa-pap based his exposition of the first fourteen (or fifteen) jätis on the
PS itself, and he quotes the PS some fifteen times (and quotes Dignaga's autocom-
mentary once, P. 258.4.5). On the nityasama jäti (RT 3, NS 23) see also B. K.
Matilal (1971), pp. 159€. On sadharmya-- and vaidharmya-- see also A. K. Warder
(1971), p. 142.
Many of these fatis had been previously discussed by Vasubandhu in his
Vadavidhi. See E. Frauvallner (1957), pp. 121ff. See also KhJ III 55, autocom-
mentary, and below, note 186.
"The Nyayapariksa is one of the works of Dignāga that do not survive
either in Sanskrit or in translation. It is cited by Dignāga himself in his PS
(chapter VI, end; see PS [P], p. 125.7) and by Santarakṣita in the latter's
Vadanyayatika. See M. Hattori (1968), p. 9 and note 52. H. Nakamura (1980), pp.
298-300, apparently overlooked the Nyayaparlkgå.
Sa-paņ is the only known Tibetan author whose writings seem to indicate a
more direct or detailed knowledge of the work. He introduces his introduction of
the fatis in the RTRG (p. 257.1.5) by saying that these were briefly discussed by
Dignliga in his Ps, but that these were extensively taught in the Nyayapariksa:
phyogs kyi glang pos kun las btus su badus te gsungs la/ rigs pa brtag par rayas
par sungs 8o//. Then he introduces his exposition of his latis nos. 15-24 by



376
saying (p. 259.1.3): "To explain a little of what was taught in the Nyayaparikga"
(tiga pa brtag par sunga pa de cung zad bahad no).
Sa-pan is not, however, recorded in his biographies to have studied the
Nyoyapariksa directly. He probably learned of it during his study of the Nyāya
Sutras with Sugatasri. The account of the jätis nos. 15-22 in the RTRG 1s ex-
tremely brief, and nowhere does Sa-paņ quote the Ny yapariksa itself. Still, as
Shakya-tachog-Idan, Mkhas ur dris lan, pp. 119, notes, this account of the lätis
was one of Sa-pan's "original" contributions (though like the nigrahasthanas, the
same treatment had in fact already appeared in the RTRG).
Sa-paņ studied his jätis nos. 23 (rab byed: prakarapa) and 24 (dus las
das kālātita in more detail in an unknown separate work, as he indicated in
RTRG, P. 259.3.3: rab byed dang, mtshungs pa dang dus las 'das pa mtshungspali
dbye ba mang po zhig yod mod kyl/ i ge manga kyis dogs pas ma brie mod/ kho
bosszhan du bshad par bita bar bya'o/. Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma rigs...nam
bahad, P. 718.3-7, sheds no light on this. But Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sdebdun
ndo...rnam bshad, p. 392,6 (196b,6) notes the mention of such a work in ancient
annotations (mchan raying), though also stating that it was not available in his
time.
In connection with his "jäti" no. 24 (kalatita), Sa-paņ makes an inte-
resting reference to Vätsyāyana, stating that he was a later Naiyoyika whereas
Dignaga had refuted the earlier Naiyāyikas (RTRG, P. 259.2.6): dus las Idas pa
yang rige pe can rgan po'1 lugsphyogs kyi lang pos bkag pa la phyis kyl ba
tsha't bu la soga pa na re dus las brgal te. Sa-paņ seems to say that Vätsyayana
replied to the refutations of Dignaga by saying that they were "istined" (kilati-
ta).
"I think the source of this quote is VN (D) 355a.5: 'di yang stan tshirs
Itar. anang ba dax. nyid, kyk nang du "dus pa'i phyir.ro//. Cf. VN (P), p. 3996.6,
which is identical except that it omits the probably unnecessary final ro. See
also VN (S). D. Shastri (1972), p. 129.5: idan api hetvábhásev antarbhävat na
Pythag vacyam //.
Perhaps the addition of the filter rigs pas (yathanyāyan) in the KhJ
quote resulted from conflation with a similar and closely following passage in the
VN, which was also quoted in RTRG, p. 257.1.6: ci de das 11 skad, du mt:shon pa'i

Dharmakirti in the final two sentences of the NB (II1 140-141) briefly defines
jātis. See Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. 2, pp. 252f, and NB (D), p. 238a.5.
Sa-pan. RTRG, P. 259.1.1, also mentions Vasubandhu's classification of the
fatis into the classes of phyin ci log (viparita). mi bden (abhūta), and "salba
(viruddha) in his Rtsod pa grub pa (Vādavidhi), explaining that Dignaga rejected
this classification. See 6. Tucci (1929), PP. 484f. See also PS VI 21 [?] (PS
[P]. p. 125.6), as quoted by Sa-paņ below, KhJ III 55, autocommentary.
On this quote see above, note 11.
Compare the almost identical passage in the RTRG, p. 252.2.5: rgol bas
bsgrub pa'i yan lag i brfod pa dang/ yan lag ma yin pa br jod pa gayis dang/
phyir Esel skyon mi be jod a dang/ skyon min br jod pa gayis 8o//.
See also ibid., pp. 251.4.6-252.1.1.
**KhJ III 12 was quoted by Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sdebdundo, P. 387.1
(194a.1).
Eristic or sophistry (alpa) was admitted by Gautama as a second type of
disputation similar to proper debate or discussion (vada), though it makes use of
such devices as quibbles (chala) and futile rejoinders. Naiyayikas such as
Våtsyāyana (NBh, 1,2,83-85) held that quibbling and similar methods "have as their
proper use the guarding of one's own views by attacking those of the opposition."
See K. Potter (1977), pp. 225 and 246. A third type of disputation they admitted
was cavil (vitapda), which aims at destroying the opponent's position without
establishing anything. The Buddhist tradition rejected both eristic and cavil, as
Sa-pan goes on to explain in more detail in the following verses.



378
On a second use of the term vitanda, see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1982), p. 521
and note 65.
The translation of the last part of the quote is conjectural. I have not
80 far been able to locate these lines among the writings of Vasubandhu. As
Khenpo Appey observed, several interpretations are possible. Glo-bo michan-chen,
Sde bdun mdo...rnam bahad, p. 387.1 (194a.1) quotes the same lines, with two small
differences at the ends of lines one and two:
gang zhig rgyal 'dod 'be' zhig 8i//
rtsod smra dam pa ma yin te//
See also the same text from the reproduction of an Dbu-med MS from Glo-bo: Tshad
ma rigs, p. 393.4.
"See also Sa-pan's Nga brgyad ma'i, p. 149.2.1, where Dharmakirti's disap-
proval of various underhanded ploys and methods for wriggling out of defeat is
mentioned: mkhas pa rnams kyi gtsug gi nor bu't bzhed pa rgol ba dang/ phyi sgol

Other underhanded methods are mentioned by Dharmakirti in his VN (D), pp.
337a.7-337b.1. See also VN (S), D. Shastri (1972), p. 68.15. This passage is
quoted in the following note.
In the Thus, p. 46.4.2 (92a.2), Sa-paņ explains what is and is not
"opposing [debate] which accords with religious principle" (chos dans mthun par
brgal ba), explaining that the Buddha cannot be opposed in a principled debate.
"One finds a similar point made in RTRG, P. 252.1.5:

These remarks of Dharmakirti are clearly aimed at NS IV,2,50, and Santa-
rakpita in his VN commentary indeed quotes that sutra in this connection. See D.
Shastri ed. (1972), p. 69. In this sutra Gautama maintains that in fact "one can
even employ dubious procedures like sophistry and cavil to make oneself more
zealous for truth and to protect it" (K. Potter (1977), p. 237).
he cang thal [bar 'gyur ba]: atiprasanga. See Bhimacarya Jhalakikar
(1978). Nyayakosa, p. 7, where atiprasanga is equated first of all with ativyaptih
"over-inclusiveness" or "overextension of definition" (Tib.: khyab ches pal, one
of the three major fallacies of definition. On the latter see G. S. Huparikar
(1948), pp. 125 and 170; J. F. Staal (1961), pp. 124f; and K. Potter (1963), p.
87. In an inference, a logical reason that is over-inclusive (1.e. that includes
a dissimilar example) is "uncertain" (anaikantika: ma nges pe). Mokşakaragupta,
TBh 25, includes atiprasanga within anaikantika. See Y. Kajiyana (1966), p. 119.
The tera atiprasange, however, is more general than ativyāpti in that it desig-
nates any description--inferential, defining or otherwise--that implies too much.

"debate which is proper to the context of teaching" and "debate which is proper to

it does not require two opponents who maintain opposing tenets.

quainted."

The Samkhya adherents apparently tried to quote the Vaisepikas' scriptures
against them. Prasastapāda in his Padārthadharmasangraha had explained that sound
was a quality of space (ākasa). This position was reached by inference: the locus
of sound had to be in akasa because it could not be in the other substances. Yet
the Vaidepikas argued that sound was nevertheless momentary. See K. Potter
(1977), pp. 286 and 300. The argument by the Vaiseşikas in favor of the imper-
manence of sound was perhaps what Dharmakirti vas referring to in NB III 52. See
Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32). vol. 2, p. 163, note 2.
Dharmakirti in his NB III 46 makes the same point (cf. Th. Stcherbatsky
[1930-32), vol. 2, p. 156):
Supposing that someone has stated a proof based on some treatises (of a
philosophical school). Even though the author of that treatise has
asserted many predicates for qualities: dharme regarding that subject
(dharmin), just that predicate which that proponent at that time wishes
to establish is the thesis which is to be established (sādhya), not
something else.

But compare NS 1,2,1 in which it is stated that accepted tenets should not
be contradicted.
The translation of PV II 46ab is identical in D and P. See PV (D), P.

the subject heading is sange rayas pa yi lung 21. srub pa dgas pa. See also L. van
der Kuijp (1983), p. 150, no. 78, where it is also mentioned that these lines
refer to the Carvāka.
See RTRG, p. 249.1.4: gzhal bya gnyis la tshad megnyis// .... angon
Ryur mngon sum dang/ Ikog gyur la rjes dpag dang/.
The two basic means of knowledge, direct perception and inference, have as
their objects "manifest" phenomena and "hidden" phenomena, respectively. Direct
perception is for example vision, which perceives its "manifest" object, such as
the blue of a cloth. In inference, on the basis of something immediately given
one recognizes the presence of an object which is not now present or visible. For
example, one understands that there is a fire someplace when one sees smoke.

***This quotation of course cannot be Vedic, but instead is probably from
some Purāņic source, perhaps a guidebook to pilgrimage places near Haridvaras

near Haridvar: Gangadvāra is Haridvar itself, Kusavarta is a ghat at Haridvar,
Nilaparvata is "the Haridwar hills called Chandi-pahad situated on the northern



383
side of the Ganges called here Nîladhârâ between Haridwar and Kankhala," and
Khanakhala is the place Just mentioned. See N. L. Dey (1927), pp. 62, 111 and

SØThe "six limits" (mtha' drug : satkoti[ka]) or six principles of inter-
pretation are the three pairs of hermeneutical categories that Sa-pan discussed
above in KhJ II 34 (D 101.2.5):
mtha' drug gang gis shes pa de//
gzhung bshad pa la shin tu mkhas//
gzhung luge chen po bahad a la mthal drug shes. dgos te/dgongs, padang dgonge pa
ma yin pa/ drang ba't doo dang nges pa'i don/ sara 11 bahin pa dang 11 bzhin me
yin pa'o//....
As Sa-pap goes on to explain, the first two are (1) special intention
dgonga pa abhiprāya, sandhyā) and (2) without special intention (dgonga pa
yin pa nasadhya?). The first includes the four "intentions" (dgoogspe!
abhiprāya) and the four "ulterior motives" (ldem dgongs : abhisapdhi) as taught in
MSA XII 16-18. On these see also D. Seyfort Ruegg (1969), P. 165, and G. Nagao
ed. (1982), Mahayanasangraha, pp. 94ff. The next pair are (3) interpretable or
provisional meaning (drang don neyartha) and (4) direct, definitive meaning
(nges pa'i don : nitārtha). For the explanation of these two Sa-paņ refers to the
Sandhinirmocann Sutra. The final pair are (5) 1.teral (sara 11 bzhin pa yatha-
ruta) and (6) non-literal (agra 11 bzhin me yin pa: naruta?). All six categories
are said by Sa-pan to have been discussed by "Candrakirti." Apparently this is a
reference to the Pradipoddhyotana commentary on the Guhya sama ja, by a Vajrayanist
Candrakirti (II) or Candrakirti-pada. On the latter author see D. Seyfort Ruegs
(1981), p. 105. On the above categories see also Sa-pan, DS, p. 315.1.1ff; Chag
lo, p. 401.1.2; and Skyes bu das pa, p. 333.2.4.
These six "limits" or "ends" as applied to the interpretation of the Anut-
taratantras were mentioned by D. Seyfort Ruegs (1962), p. 330, and they have been
studied in more detail by M. Broido (1983) and E. Steinkellner (1978). Note that
Sa-pan applies these six to all the basic treatises, and not just to the highest
Tantras. Bu-ston Rin-chen-grub wrote a book on the six limits," his Mtha! drug
rab sal, which was studied by Shakya-achog-Idan. See Kun-dgal-grol-mchog.
Papdita, p. 132.7.
cf, Mokşākaragupta, TBh 30 (Kajiyama (1966), p. 139): "How can there
be two kinds of omniscient beings ... and also different schools among
Buddhists?
[The author :) This is not to be confuted because the Blessed One... taught
all these different doctrines) in order to introduce sentient beings (of dif-
ferent capacities] into truths."

» Asanga in the final section of the AS explains this line as requiring
special interpretation since it was spoken with a special motive. See W. Rahula
(1971), p. 184. Rahula, ibid., note 3, refers to the very similar verse in the
Dhammapada: XXI 5. For the Sanskrit see Pralhad Pradhan (1950), p. 109.1, and
Nathmal Tatia (1976), p. 155.6. For a discussion of this verse see F. Bernhard
(1968-69), pp. 577. For the commentaries in Tibetan see Rgyal-ba
putra), Mngon pachos kun nas btus pa'i rnam par bshad pa, P vol.shi, p. 3956.4;
Bu-ston, Chos mngon pa, p. 744.1; and Gzhan-dga', Chosangon pa, p. 384 (192b).
Sa-paņ quotes this line also in KhJ I 21 and II 34. See KhJ (D), pp.
83.4.2 (tha 1686.2) and 101.4.2 (tha 204b.2).
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, pp. 2575.1-258a.3, takes verses III 24-26 as
the point of departure for his first real comment on part III. He explains that
all the Buddha's declarations that such things as the tathagatararbha, sunyata,
and nisprapanca exist were actually stated provisionally. In this connection he
quotes the Lokānuvartană Sutra (Jig rten mthun ug gimdo), (D), vol. (200)
tsha, p. 306,3-4. (For various citations of this verse and its Sanskrit text, see
K. Mimaki (1982), P. 135, note 386.) In the vision of the Saint Carya) there is
neither existence nor non-existence, and on this point Glo-bo mkhan-chen quotes
Sa-pan's Chag lo (D). P. 412.3.5. In the "multifarious vision" (of the Saint who
is not in concentrative meditation), such things are said to exist, and here the
Commentator, Glo-bo mkhan-chen, cites lines from the RGV.
commentator also mentions the opinion of some opponent: "Since those
things were taught as having provisional truth, one must maintain that they do not
exist on the level of transactional usage (wyavahara)." But such people, ac-
cording to Glo-bo mkhan-chen, fail to discriminate correctly the provisional from
the direct, definitive truth, because according to their opinion they must affirm
that all the surface level of truth does not exist on the level of transactional
usage.
For the principles of scriptural debate in general, Glo-bo mkhan-chen
directs his reader to the AS of Asanga, no doubt referring to its final section,
the 'Bel baligtam ram par nges pa, in which debating is briefly treated. For a
more detailed knowledge of how scriptures are to be established and refuted, he
recommends Sa-pap's explanations in his DS, probably referring to the noteworthy
lines on p. 301.1.1 (9a.1):

On the tathāgatagarbha doctrine and its interpretation by the 14th-century
scholar Bu-ston, see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1969), (1971) and (1973). Regarding Sa
pan's opinion in particular see Seyfort Ruegg (1969), p. 58, note 5, and (1973),
pp. 31ff.
For a discussion of the nature and use of "intermediate verses" (bar
skabs kyi tshigs su bcad pa : antaraśloka) in Indian and Tibetan treatises, see K.
Mimaki (1980).
It seems that intermediate verses--together with "concluding verses
were considered by Sa-pan's editors to belong to the basic verses of his works.
See for instance his RT, P. 166.2.5, where an intermediate verse is included among
the basic verses. For similar examples of the inclusion of "concluding verses,"
see RT, pp. 156.2.6 and 157.1.1.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen in his RT commentary (Sde bdun mdo...rnam bahad, p. 23.2
[12a.2]), quotes two interesting explanations of the bar skabs kyi tshigs su bcad
pa from Indian Pranana sources: bar skabs kyi tshisa su bcad pali don ni/ don

Khenpo Appey remembered his teacher, the great Brag-8.yab Blo-gros, ex-
plaining that an intermediate verse suns up the meaning of the earlier and later
parts of the given text (tshiga bcad szhung 'di'i mgo, mjug gnyis kyi don badus
pa).

The three disciplines are:

(3) lhas pa ting nge 'dzin gyi bslab pa: adhisamadhisiksa
Each of the three "baskets" of the Tripitaka is supposed to treat chiefly one of
these disciplines: Sila being treated in the Vinaya, prajña in the Abhidharma, and
samadhi in the Sutras. See for instance Sa-pan, Nga brgyad, p. 151.1.4.

could not accept "all" (sabbam), by which he meant "all uprisings and relinkings."
But the Buddha takes "all" literally, and shows by his question the logical
problem implicit in such a statement. Dirghanakha was the maternal nephew of
Śäriputra, on which see G. P. Malalasekera (1960), p. 1081.

In the Kanjur there is another short Sutra with the title Kun tu rayu ba
sen ringe kyis zhus pa (P 1009, D 342?), Sanskrit: Dirghanakhaporivrā fakapari-
prccha-nama-sútra. But it does not contain this discussion.
This sentence is probably a gloss inserted into the Sutra quotation, as
Professor D. Seyfort Ruegg suggested to me. The point made by the glossator is
that the Buddha was applying the law of double negation in this passage. See also
Sa-pan's use of such reasoning in KhJ III 36. In general, the Buddha's style of
argument in the Sūtras typically employs double negatives and hypothetical and
alternative judgments. See F. Watanabe (1972), p. 978 (53).
In many cases, however, the Buddha himself did not feel bound to answer a
question with either an affirmative or negative; as mentioned above, many ques-
tions were to be set aside without giving either answer.
On the principle of excluded middle in Buddhism, see A. Kunst (1957), and
for the Madhyamaka see D. Seyfort Ruegg (1969), pp. 383ff, and (1977), pp. 5, 49,
52 and 54. Cf. the sources listed in ibid., p. 71, note 185. On the law of
contradiction in Indian logic in general, see J. F. Staal (1962).

cang mi smra bar syur to (EtuspIqbhūta?). In Buddhist canonical
writings, silence (Pāli: tunhibhāva) was often a sign of agreement or affirmation
which the Buddha himself also used. See G. Nagao.(1955), pp. 137f, and D. Seyfort
Ruegg (1981), p. 35. On the silence of the Buddha see C. Nagao (1955). Cf. T. W.
Organ (1954-55).
In the Pali scriptures these questions are regularly enumerated not as
fourteen but as ten. In the Majjhima Nikāya, Sutta 63, for example, the questions
on these topics by Maluhkyäputta were set aside as not edifying (H. C. Warren
[1973), pp. 117-122):
(1) that the world (loka) is eternal
(2) that the world is not eternal
(3) that the world is finite
(4) that the world is infinite
(5) that the soul (jiva) and body are identical
(6) that the soul is one thing and the body another
(7) that the saint [i.e. the Tathāgatal exists after death
(8) that the saint does not exist after death
(9) that the saint both exists and does not exist after death
(10) that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death
Cf. Vaccha's questions, Majjhima Nikāya, Sutta 72 (H. C. Warren (1973), pp. 123-
128).
In the lists as they appear in the Chinese translations, there are sixteen or
fourteen questions enumerated. For sixteen, four alternatives are given for each
of the four main topics, i.e. the eternality of the world (loka), the finitude of
the world, the relation of fiva and body, and the existence of the Tathagata after
death. For the enumeration of fourteen, the four alternatives are given for the
first, second and fourth topics, while regarding the third, the relation of body
and Iva, it is only asked whether they are the same or different. Professor N.
Aramaki has suggested to me that the enumeration of fourteen may represent a Mula-
sarvästivādin scriptural tradition which was preserved both in Tibet and in some
Chinese Sutras. He also kindly referred me to the list of fourteen as found in
the Chinese Samyukta Agama, Taisho no. 99, Sūtra 962/963, Taisho vol. 2, pp. 245€
and to the study of these 11sts by Tetsuno Watsuji, Genshi bukkyo no Jissentetsu-
gaku (Practical Philosophy of Primitive Buddhisa) (Tokyo: 1927), pp. 135. For
other studies on the points not explicated (avyákrtavastu) and the four alterna-
tive positions (catuskoti), see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1977), pp. 58, note 4.

that is altogether 'not so' (nêti) cannot be stated in some determinate manner in
terms of a logico-ontological position) by the omniscient Sage, the teacher las
refrained from stating that the world (loka) has a posterior) limit, does not
have one, both has and does not have one, and neither has nor does not have one."
Cf. also RA II 14-15, MMK XXII 12 and XXV 21-23.
On the Buddha's rejection of certain questions as unfruitful (e.g. on the
nature of the "self," on the posterior limit of the world, etc.), see also E.
Frauvallner (1973), vol. 1, pp. 172-177. As Frauvallner observed in connection
with the Buddha's discussions with Malunkyaputra and Vatsagotra mentioned above in
note 75), "The teaching of the Buddha is throughout governed by an attempt to
avoid unnecessary theoretical discussions."
A sinflar point is made by Sa-pan in the DS, pp. 316.4.6-317.1.1:

On vegetarianism and the eating of meat in the history of Buddhism, see
D. Seyfort Rueg8 (1980).
That which constitutes "meat that is pure in three ways" is interpreted
differently by the Tibetan schools. The usual Dge-lugs-pa (and Theravadin) inter-
pretation is that it is meat about which one has not seen, heard or even suspected
that the animal was killed especially for oneself. The Sa-skya-pa interpretation
following Säkyaprabha vas more rigorous. The eater should not have seen, heard or
suspected that the meat was from an animal killed for its ment (aha yi cheddu.
The meat fron animals which had died from other causes (shi sha) was allowed, and
as an exception the meat of slaughtered animals was allowed for sick monks. See

*To prove that a tenet or scriptural passage is of special intent (drongs
pa can), one has to demonstrate (1) the motive for teaching it with special intent:
(dgonge te Rsungs pa'i dgos pa), (2) the subject that was ultimately intended
(dronge azhi), and (3) the criterion which shows that the statement conflicts with
the real state of things (dngos la gnod byed tshad ma). See Shakya-mchog-idan,
Tshad m rigs...dongs, vol. 9, p. 237.5. For instances of the application of
these three, see Sa-pan, DS, 301.1.2 (na 9a); Thus, p. 27.4.4 (tha 54b) and 39.2.1
(tha 77b); and Bsod-nans-rtse-mo, Byang chub, p. 494.2.5. The above-mentioned
passage of the DS has been translated by D. Seyfort Ruegs (1973), p. 32, with
reference to Bu-ston, Bde bzhin sshege, and Sgra-tshad-pa.

phyoga su lhung. In non-technical language phyoga lhung means to be
partial to one side, to be biased.
Sa-pap here employs a dilemma based on the principle of double negation.
C. the use of the same principle attributed to the Buddha above in KhJ III 28.
This type of negation is thus "relative," i.e., presuppositional and implicative
(mayin dgas pa : paryudāsapratigedha). See D. Seyfort Rue88 (1983), p. 231, note
74. On the necessity of following tenets, and the expression "Who would debate
with an ox?" cf. Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...rnam bshad, p. 22.4 (110.4):
gal te grub mtha'i rjes su mi 'brang ngo zhe na/ da ni baglang dang suzhis
rtsod par byed de mi smra ba'i tshul 'dzin to
I have not translated the (erroneous?) negative of the 'dus pa ma yin pa.
This argument by the Samkhya (see karika 17) has been widely discussed in the Pra-
mapa literature, and its mention in the Buddhist texts goes back at least to the
NMukhand PS of Dignaga. In PS III 2 it is referred to in connection with a
thesis maintained mentally (dod pa) in the midst of Dignaga's definition of a
sadhya (bagrubbya). Dignaga here establishes the intended thesis of the



394
proponent as the real thesis, even if the opponent tries the stratagem of not
explicitly stating it.
Sa-pan in the RTRG (p. 246.1.4) quotes PS III 2ab as follows:
ngo bo kho na bstan bya ba//
bdag nyid 'dod dang ma gsal ba//
Vasudhararakita's translation (following Kitagawa [1965), pp. 471f):
rang gi ngo bo dang nyid ldan (=bstan?]//
rang dang 'dod 'gyur ma bsal ba'o//
Kanakavarman's translation of the whole verse as preserved in PS (P), p. 66.4:
rang di ngo bo kho na bstan//
bdag 'dod rang gi chos can la//
mngon sum don dang Ijes dpa, dang//
yid ches grags pas ma bsal ba'o//
of the five unacceptable types of theses, the first four were already taught in
the Nyāyamukha, as Go-rams-pa observes in Sde bdun, p. 119b.2. On this verse see
also T. Tillemans (1984a), p. 376, note 42.
Dharmakirti's discussions of this can be found for instance in PV IV 28-29
and NB 48-49, 89-90. See NB (D), p. 234.2, and 'Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol.
pp. 158-160, and 203f. Cf. S. C. Vidyabhusana (1921), pp. 315f, and S. Mooker-
jee (1935), p. 348. See also A. Kunst (1957), p. 147.
As in the NB, this reasoning of the Samkhya is also mentioned twice in the
RTRG: pp. 245.4.1 and 246.1.5. In the first place it is mentioned by Sa-pan to
agree with Dharmakirti against Dignāga that this need not be considered an in-
stance of a separate class of contradictory (viruddha) reason. The second mention
is in connection with the definition of sadhya by means of a negative determina-
tion which rejects five erroneous aspects of a thesis to be proved (as listed in
PS III 2). See also Go-rama-pa, Sde bdun, p. 623 (cha 120a.2); and Shakya-nchog-
ldan, Tahad ma rigs...rnam bahad, p. 682.3. Inga po 'di bsdu na ...; and Tshad
ma riga...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 419.3.
As Professor K. Potter pointed out to me, the Sankhya basic text of karika
17 as it now exists actually maintains as an explicit thesis: "There exists a
puruşa" (puruşăsti).
This sophistical argumentation is identical in principle with the above
reasoning of the Samkhya adherent as it was traditionally characterised by Bud-
dhist Pramana scholarship. The Cārvāka implicitly affirms a self or person as the
subject of his thesis, and his implicit thesis must be considered his real thesis
even though it is not explicitly stated. This "syllogistie application of posses-
sing a second" (gyis bcas kyi sbyor ba : sadvitiyaprayoga) is refuted by



395
Dharmakirti PV IV 34-35. See also Go-rama-pa, Rgyas pall, p. 165.3.6.
Dharmakirti seems also to reject a sadvitīyaprayoga reasoning of some
Mimāņsakas in the VN (S), p. 66.16; VN (D), p. 336.2; and VN (P), p. 375a.6.
Santarakṣita, VNV (S), p. 66, refers in this connection to the Mimamsa Sūtra 1,1,2
and its Bhasya. See D. Shastri (1972), p. 66.
Sa-pan discusses this reasoning in RTRG, P. 246.2.2, in connection with the
word 'dod pa of PS III 2, just after the discussion of the similar Sankhya argu-
mentation: de bzhin du gayis bcas kyi sbyor ba la'ang Efes 'gro med de bun pa

As mentioned by H. Nakamura (1980). p. 376, S. Watanabe translated into
Japanese and examined "Sadvitiyaprayoga (Pramāņavārttika IV 28-41, an argumenta-
tion by Cārvākas)" in Mikkyogaku, nos. 13 and 14 (1977), pp. 194-209.

two views.

In his Thus, (D) p. 31.1.6-2.1, Sa-pan further develops his position on the
ultimate truth when giving his definition of the two truths:
Some people say, "The defining marks (1.e. definitions) of the two
truths are: that which is possible to be made an object of mind is the
surface truth, [and] that which is not included within objects of mind
is the ultimate truth." Those people base themselves on the statement
in the BCA [IX 2):
[The truth-level of] ultimate reality is not the province of mind.
Mind is held to be the surface (level of truth).
These are instances of what is being defined (mtshangzhi) and are not
the defining marks. Therefore our own tradition is as follows: That
ich is established as an object of an uncritical mind is "the surface
level." That which is not established as the object of a critical mind
is "the ultimately real." The absence of any [disproving] impairment
regarding the object of each one's mind is "truth."
See also Thos, pp. 32.2.5 (636.5) and 44.1.6 (878.6). And according to
Thos, (D) p. 31.3.1: "This ultimate truth, moreover, is not the causal efficiency
recognized by dialecticians. Here we maintain it to be just the 'free from
discursive developments' (nisprapafca) which is recognized in the Madhyamaka."
Cf. RTRG, Pp. 172.1.2 and 211.4.6.
There is also an interesting discussion of the two truths by Sa-pan in his
Bkal gdams do kor, p. 403.3.4:

Go-rams-pa, Royal ba, p. 147.1 (ca 74a), discusses Sa-pap's opinion in some
detail, after presenting the definitions of ultimate reality according to Rngog
(p. 144.4) and Khyung Rin-chen-grags (p. 146.1) and their criticisms by Gt sang-
nag-pa and Rma-bya-ba, respectively. In this account we are told that Gtsang-nag-
pa's and Rngog's positions are not to be identified, and that Gtsang-nag-pa added
the phrase "found through reasoning" (rige pas rnyed pe) to his definition of the
ultimate. Rngog and Khyung are closer in opinion. Shakya-uchog-Idan, Dhume
rnam, vol. 15, p. 56,5-6, described Rngog's interpretation of Santideva's state-
ment (BCA IX 2) on this point, and in a subsequent passage Shakya-mchog-ldan gives
a summary of no fewer than eleven early Tibetan scholars' opinions (ibid., PP.
72.4-74.5).
On the inexpressibility of ultimate reality according to the early Indian
Madhyamaka, see D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 18, where it is said in connection
with MMK XVIII 9 that "the characteristic of reality (tattva) is to be not depen-
dent on another (1.e. not to be communicated)," and on p. 42 in connection with
the same verse, this is said to be one of the essential rationales for Nagarjuna's
philosophical procedure--"the principle that ultimate reality (tattva) cannot be
expressed or conceived in the frame of vikalpa and prapafica." "For the same
reason Nagarjuna's procedure cannot be described as anti-philosophical even if he
maintains no propositional thesis (pratiffa) intended to establish a speculative
metaphysical system."



398
On the other hand, Candrakīrti in his Prasannapadã comentary on the MMK
defined "the paramartha on the basis of the MMK (xviit 7 and 9) as that with
respect to which there is no functioning of words and cognitions, for it is not
communicated by another, and it is still, directly knowable (pratyatma vedya by
the Aryas, and beyond all discursive development (prapañca)." See D. Seyfort
Ruegs (1981), p. 75, and also (1977), pp. 11, 18f, and note 42. Cf. the similar
account of Go-rans-pa, Royal ba, p. 158.6 (ca 795.6).
On the problem of the knowability of ultimate reality, see also D. Seyfort
Ruegg (1971), passia, and (1973), p. 60.
Vimalakirtinirdesa Sūtra, VIII 33 (E. Lamotte (1962), p. 317). These lines
are also quoted below in the autocommentary to KhJ III 52, where they are expli-
citly attributed to the "Li tstsha byi'i mdo." This is a designation for the
Vimalakirtinirdesa because Vimalakirti himself is "the Licchavi."
On silence in the Vimalakirtinirdesa, (D 176: Drimmed par grans pas
batan pa). See E. Lamotte (1962), pp. 109, 317f. Three more recent transla-
tions of the Sūtra also exist--by R. A. F. Thurman (1976), Bhiksu Prasadika and
Lal Mani Joshi (1981), and the English rendering of Lamotte's translation by Sara
Boin (1976). These are discussed by de Jong (1984), p. 89.
The Vimalakirtinirden 1s quoted by JKänagar bha in his Sattvadvayavibhanga
to the same effect. In the extant Tibetan translation of that treatise (D 3881),
pp. 60-6b, it is said that "as stated in the Vimalakirtinirdesa, only silence is
adequate to the dharma-mukha which is without duality (advaya) and is free from
discursive development (nişprapanca)" (D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 70).

Meaningful or "semioticized" silence is a part of the Madhyamaka methodolo-
sy and is related to the silence of the Arya (ärya tusp.I[m) bhava) and the silence
of the Buddha. See D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), pp. 34f, the sources cited in 1bid.,

D. Seyfort Ruegs (1983), p. 232, note 78, observes that this non-affirma
tion of the Madhyamaka described here by Sa-pan is a "case of non-presuppositional
and non-implicative absolute negation" (med par dgag pe – prasa iyapratişedha).
Ck. the reasoning mentioned above, note 87. On these types of negation see also
Y. Kajiyama (1973), pp. 167-174; J. F. Staal (1962); and the sources cited in D.
Seyfort Ruegs (1977), p. 59, note 10.

won the terms mdo sde spyod pa'i dbu mo pa and rnal 'byor spyod pa'i dbu
ma pa, see K. Mimaki (1983), pp. 163€ and (1982), pp. 41-44. Aa Mimaki (1982)
shows, these terms of a double filiation appear in Tibetan writings from at least
the early 9th century, and according to D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), p. 59, their



usage may be dated slightly earlier, to the end of the 8th century. As Mimaki
(1982) mentions, the earliest known occurence of such terms in an Indian work 1s
in the Pancakrama Tika by the early-llth-century Kashmiri nun Lakşmi. As cited in
Ibid., note 99, the latter work is quoted by "Jan-dbyangs-bzhad-pa in his Grub
atha' chen mo, chapter ca (Svatantrika chapter), pp. 778.5-775.2 (New Delhi ed.:
Pp. 823-824; II 106a-b).
1V Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSH, p. 259a.1, understands Sa-paņ as disapproving
of these mixed terminologies, and quotes from KhJ III 45 in support of this. To
show such combinations to be absurd, he points out that one would also have to
come up with various other combined names for other instances where to schools
share tenets. Glo-bo mkhan-chen was disagreeing with the answer he was given on
this point by Shakya-mchog-ldan in the latter's Mkhas. Slug dris lan, p. 147.2:
"nges par 'thad do."
Here, as Khenpo Appey suggested, Glo-bo mkhan-chen may have missed Sa-pan's
intended meaning. Sa-pan merely seems to be saying that it one maintains a school
with such "wixed" tenets, one should make sure to remove any contradictions by
means of reasoning. Whatever elements they may include, the tenets of one's own
school should be internally compatible and consistent.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, P. 259b.1. concludes by saying, "Nevertheless, some of
those terms which have been previously current such as those taught in the work of
the great translator Dpal-brtsegs were left as they were (read: sor bzhag] and
were merely mentioned by name in such works as [Grags-pa-rgyal-mtshan's) Mngon
rtoge ljon shing." Glo-bo mkhan-chen was thus probably referring to the La ba'1
rim pa bahad pa of Dpal-brtsegs (which also appears again in the Peking and
Narthang Tanjurs under the different title Lta ba'i rim peyi man ngaganang ba
bcu bdun). This work indeed employs combined names for the sub-schools of the
Madhyamaka. See D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 59, and K. Mimaki (1982), pp. 41f.
Glo-bomkhan-chen probably also had in mind the Lta ba't khyad par of another
early translator, Ye-shes-sde, since this too employs such terms (see also KhJNSH,
p. 278a. 2: angon gyi lo tså ba dpal brtsega la sogs pas bahad pa'i rnam Rrangs).
Shakya-nchog-Idan, Mkhas ug dris lan, p. 147.4, had referred Glo-bo nkhan-chen
to this text as the Lta ba'i rjed byang. On the work of Ye-shes-sde see Y. Imaeda
(1975), D. Seyfort Ruege (1981b), and R. Mimaki (1982), pp. 40-42, 44.
The reference to the Mngon rtogs lon shing is to Grags-pa-royal-mtshan,
Rgyud kyl mngon par rtogs pa rin po che'i ljon shing, p. 15.3.2 (1300.2). This
has been studied by K. Mimaki (1982), pp. 318. It is also cited as
correct by Go-rans-pa, Zab mo, p. 265.1 (52.1), though the latter rejects a
twofold division of real 'byor spyod pa and mde ade spyod pa as incomplete. See



ibid., p. 269.3 (51.3).

with autocommentary is quoted in Ibid., p. 4.46 (20.4f).

Literally, this is one who sees this side or the near side. Khenpo Appey defined
the term as follows: (1) "one who considers only the present life" (tshe 'di kho
na la 1ta mkhan), or (2) "one who is not a Saint (arva)" (phage
D y in pa).
Th. Stcher batsky (1930-32), vol. 2, p. 334, note 4, translated tshur mthong as "an
ordinary man." C. L. Sopa and J. Hopkins (1976), p. 117: "etymologically, the
term "short-sighted' or 'one who looks nearby' refers to one who does not see
beyond ordinary worldly appearances." Cf. also Lati Rinpoche and E. Napper
(1980), p. 57: "one who looks nearby (1.e. an ordinary being)."
AV Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Khush, p. 2606.4, understands this as a reference to
the Thub pa'i drongs sal where Sa-paņ refuted various erroneous tenets. The
passage referred to is in the section explaining the perfection of discriminative
understanding (pp. 23.4.5-34.1.5 [466.5-76a.5]). The structure of the beginning
of the chapter is as follows:
1. The definition of discriminative understanding
II. The (detailed) ascertainment of the nature of discriminative understanding
A. Identification of the opposite
1. Identification of imperfect understanding
2. Reflection on its harmful consequences
B. The individual discernment of the nature of the antidotes
1. The antidote to the causes of imperfect understanding
2. The antidote to the resulting imperfect understanding
1. The refutation of non-Buddhist schools
11. The refutation of erroneous opinions of Buddhists
(A) Refutation of those who maintain Sravaka tenets
(B) Refutation of followers of the Mahayana who erroneously



402
maintain teachings of provisional meaning as of definitive
meaning
(C) Refutation of those who uphold as Buddhist a doctrine that
is neither Sravaka nor Mahāyāna
(1) Refutation of a previously appeared Chinese tradition
(2) Refutation of a later tradition that follows the
former
(3) Refutation of a tradition that maintains a meditation
of the Nirākära ("cognitive-image-leas") Mind-Only as
being the Mahamudrā
(4) Refutation of a fallacious semblance of the Perfec-
tion of Discriminative Understanding (pra Baparamita)
that is held to be Mahāmudra
first translation of section (1), see Roger Jackson (1982), pp. 91-93. That
writer, p. 90, described the Thub pa'i dgonga gel as "possibly the oldest
Tibetan history of Buddhism ... written in Mongolia sometime between 1244 and
1251." The Thub pali dgongs ssal is in fact a religious treatise on the stages of
the Bodhisattva's path (1.e. It is a special kind of lam rin, not a history,
though it does contain this one "historical" passage). It was composed and widely
taught by Sa-pan before his departure from Tibet; however, according to a final
addendum at the end of the work, Sa-pan sent a copy of it in its final form back
to his disciples in Tibet after leaving for the Mongol camp in Liang-chou. Note
that the Sa-skya-pa tradition usually cites its abbreviated title as Thub pa('1)
dgonga esal, and not as Thub pa'i dgonge pe rab asal.
R. Jackson (1982), pp. 93f, suggests that Sa-pap in section (1) "put into
the mouth of Kamalasila" words that reflect "more closely what a Buddhist logician
[1.e. Sa-pan himself) would like the acarya to have said than what he actually
said." But it is difficult to substantiate this. Kamalasila himself was of
course a highly accomplished Buddhist logician, and regarding his dialectical
procedure, it was typical for him to negate the views of his opponents by dividing
them into sets of alternatives and then refuting the alternatives one by one. See
for instance his MÃI (Dbu ma snang ba). (P) pp.1989.6-198b.4, and the translation
of that passage by S. Moriyama (1984), p. 15, note 24.
Moreover, to know how closely Sa-pap followed his sources or whether he
altered their content to suit his own purposes, one would have to know what
sources Sa-pap based his account on and examine their contents. The second task
is not possible at present, but in the Thub pa'i dgonge sal Sa-paņ does cite four
written sources (pp. 25.3.6 and 25.4.1): the chronicles known as Royal bahed,
Dpa' (or Dba'?) bzhed and 'Ba! bzhed, and "other bka' chems writings" (bka' chens



kyi yi ge gzhan. See also Sa-pan, Skyes bu dan pa, p. 332.4, where he again
explains the sources of this account: 'di dag gi lo sgus. rnams/ rayal bzhed/
dpal bahed/ bange bzhed rnama mthun par snang/ bdag gis kyang ka ma la shi la'i
rles su "brangs nas bahad/. Just above, (ibid., p. 332.3), Sa-pan mentioned the
Dbu ma sgom rim geum and Dbu ma snang ba of Kamalasila. That Sa-pan in his Skyes
bu dan pa referred to the three Tibetan histories was noted already by A. Vostri-
kov (1970), p. 25, note 55.
R. Jackson, p. 93, translates the references to the three chronicles as
"the Royal bahed dba' bzhed chronicles," and comments, p. 98, note 7. "This almost
certainly refers to the Rgyal rabs sba bzhed, an early chronicle that is concerned
chiefly with the reign of Khri srong lde btsan." of the three chronicles, the
only one that is extant is the Sba bzhed ('Ba' bzhed in Sa-pan's list?), of which
the Zhabs btags me version was edited by R. A. Stein (1961). There is also one
version of the Sba bzhed, recently published from Beijing (1980, second printing
1982) based on a manuscript in the Mi-rigs-rig-gnas-pho-brang library, in which
an account of the debate almost identical to that in the Thub pali. dgonge esal 1s
related. See Sba Gsal-snang, Sba bzhed, pp. 72-75, where the passage is intro-
duced with the words yang lurs acig la.
One should also note that fragments of some of the works attributed to the
master Mahayana in Sa-pan's account have indeed been found among the Tun Huang
documents, though not all were by Mahāyāna himself. See S. Karmay (1975), p. 153,
on the identification of the Bsam gtan nyal ba'i 'khor lo (Pelliot tibétain 811),
Bsam gan gyi lon (Pelliot tibétain 117), and Mdo sde brgyad cu'i khung (Pelliot
tibétain 818; compare Pelliot tibétain 996). Cf, R. Jackson (1982), p. 98, note
6, and G. W. Houston (1980), p. 5. Sa-pap, Skyes bu dam pa, pp. 332.1.1-2,
explains the contents of the five works attributed to Mahayana, as was also
recorded by S. Karnay (1975), ibid.
on this work see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), pp. 62. This hundredfold
classification was the subject of later discussion. Glo-bo mkhan-chen as a young
scholar had asked Shakya-mchog-ldan, "Which words in the Tarkajvālā teach the 'In
the Tarkavala they were summarized into one hundred' that [Sa-pan) mentioned?"
Shakya-nchog-Idan's answer, Mkhas jug dris lan, pp. 130.5-131.3, was that one
could neither point out the specific place that taught it nor deny that it was
taught as such in the work. And Shakya-mchog-Idan held that it was not sub-
stantially wrong to classify them as one hundred, for many basic scriptures clear-
ly state the numerical determinateness of the tenets as four less than one
hundred, and this, he believed, was what the general content of the Tarka vila
seems to convey. He then listed the groups of Tirthika dialecticians as follows:



18 sngon gyi mthar rtog si Ita ba
44 phyi ma'i mthar ctos si 1ta ba
14 lung du wa bstan pa'i Ita ba
20 'jig ita ["118 tshoga la lta ba], "which issue
forth from the five views which are their 'root.""
Shakya-mchog-Idan furthermore suggested that the number of views attributed to the
Tarkavala by Grags-pa-rgyal-atshan, viz. 363, may be a scribal error in which 363
was written instead of 163. (But as I was informed by Dr. Chr. Lindtner, the
number 363 indeed appears in TJ V, 108.) See also Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sdebdun
mdo...phyogs snge, . 8.1-10.3 (45.1-5b.3), where the list of some one hundred and
twenty theories from this source 18 given.
When Glo-bo mkhan-chen wrote his KhJNSh, he did not mention Shakya-chog-
1dan's system of enumeration. Instead, on p. 264b, he discussed the classifica-
tion and numbering of the non-Buddhist schools quoting from the Dbu na rin chen
sgron ma ("Madhyamakarathapradipa). (The latter is ascribed to Bhavaviveka, but
is perhaps the work of a Bhāvaviveka II; see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), p. 66 and
note 214.) The following are taught there, according to Glo-bo mkhan-chen:
363 1ta ba'i 'phreng ba
62 lta ba
20 jis tshogs kyi ri bo
12 byed pa'i skyes bu
12 bdag tu smra ba
5 1ta ba
3 lta ba
2 lta ba
Next Glo-bokhan-chen quotes from the Rnam bshad dag ldan of Grags-pa-rgyal-
mtshan for its commentary on Heva fra Tantra 1.x, 12, which is interpreted as indi-
cating the five main schools. Grags-pa-rgyal-mtshan then summarizes the enumera-
tive classifications of these "erroneous views": they may be reduced to 360, or to
62. Moreover, those can be reduced to twenty 18 tahogs la lta bo. And the stos
se gzhi tshurs pa are here reduced to five doctrines. Those may be further
reduced to two: eternalist or annihilationist. And those may finally be reduced
to a single category: "self postulating" (bdar tu dzin po).
Somewhat later Glo-bo mkhan-chen presents the opinion of some authorities
'ga' zhig geung) on how the Tirthika theories are summarized into one hundred in
the Tarkajväla:



16 sngon kyi mthar. rtog ge [read: gi) mthal dang ldan
i idan la Itag chad gnyis su phye bas...
8 ngag si .yeng ba can
1 gyu med smra ba

16 'dus shes at dan pa
16 'dus shes yod min med min
10 mthong ba' chos la ngan "das Đà
1 chad sura
100
Glo-bo mkhan-chen then goes on to list a different way of classifying and enumera-
ting these theories as found in a commentary on the Phung poInga'i rab tu byed pa
(Palicaskandhaprakarana) of Vasubandhu:
50 jig pa la lta ba
10 mthar "dzin syi lta ba
24 1ta ba mchor "dzin (gyi lta ba]
10 tshul khrins dang brtul zhugs schog'dzin gvi lua ba
6 log par lta ba
100
This comment no doubt expands the basic fivefold classification of theories found
in the basic work (P 5560), si, 159,3 (vol. 113, p. 238.2.3).
Glo-bo mkhan-chen also opined that of the above two ways of arriving at one
hundred, the latter was through a division of the five main schools [?], while the
former embraced all five schools in general (cf. Shakya-mchog-Idan, Mkhas ug
dris lan, p. 131.1). He also states that the Dbu na rin chen erron ma explains
two da Itar mthar rtog, whereas these are said not to be found in the Tarka-
jvālā.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen also investigated this problem in his Sde bdun
ado...phyors snga, p. 10 (5b), but did not reach a final conclusion.
For other classifications of Ita ba, see Bu-ston, Chosangon pa, p.
170.15€, esp. p. 173.5 (wa 48a.5), where he discusses the sixty-two lta ba men-
tioned in the Mdo ade tshanga pali dra ba (Brahma jala Sutra), and Glo-bonkhan-
chen, Sde bdun mdo...phyors snga, p. 7.5E (40.5), where several others are
listed.



406
1 Sa-pan followed this fivefold grouping in several of his own works. It
was also accepted by his predecessors Phywa-pa and Grags-pa-rgyal-mtshan, his
students Lho-pa kun-mkhyen Rin-chen-dpal and Zhang Rgyal-ba-dpal, and by later
scholars such as Bla-ma-dam-pa Beod-nams-rgyal-mtahan and Dbus-pa B1o-gsal. See
D. Jackson (1985), pp. 9, note 7, and 11, note 16. Bcon-ldan Rigs-pa't-ral-gri
apparently criticized this fivefold system. See Glo-bomkhan-chen, Sde bdun
mdo...phyoge snga, p. 11.4 (6.4).
According to Shakya-uchog-ldan, Mkhas jur dris lan, p. 136.7, Dbus-pa
Blo-gsal criticized the KhJ for its inclusion of the Gsang-bar-smra-ba in the same
group as the Rig-byed-pa. This is a reference to Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, p. 44.2, who
bases himself on the Tattvasamgraha:
kha cig rig byed a dang asang ba pa rnam grangs su 'chad pa 'di niches mi rung

The Gsang-bar-smra-ba-pa are identified as Vedāntins by Shakya-chog-ldan
in his Mkhas ug dris lan, p. 135.6. One should also note that the Gahung lugs
legs par bshad pa, a treatise on siddhanta falsely ascribed to Sa-pap, also
advocated a radically separate classification of the Vedānta from the Mimamsa.
See D. Jackson (1985), p. 4. cf. also Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...phyoge
anga, P. 14,5 (75.5), where Rma-bya Byang-chub-brtson-'grus and some others are
said to have identified the Spyod-pa-ba with the Ngo-bo-nyid-rgyur-sara-ba.
ve Alternatively, this may mean "devotees of Brahman," as Sa-pap discusses
below, commentary to III 44. But Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, p. 7a.4, also reads tshanga
pa.
This is a reference to the Prabhākara, the branch of the Mimpso founded
by Prabhakara (c. 650-720). In some ways it "might be held to provide a vie
media between Buddhism and Nyaya" (K. Potter (1977), p. 14). This school is also



407
mentioned by Mokşakaragupta in his TBh. See below, note 177. It is unclear why
Sa-paņ associates the Prabhakara with the Sāņkhya, though one suggested
explanation is that the name refers to the Samkhya theory of causation.
Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, p. 78.3, classifies the Gsal-byed-pa (Prabhakara) among
his "Vaippava" class, and states that Gsal-byed-pa, 'od-byed-pa and Nyi-ma-pa are
synonyms. But the 'Od-byed-pa should be "followers of Uddyotakara." Dbus-pa B1o-
gsal later (p. 775.1) mentions this school as "Od-byed-pa-dag." See K. Mimaki
(1980a), p. 151.
1°Clo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 266b.3, states that the Sanskrit equiva-
lent of ("Jig-rten) Rgyang-'phen (pa) or Rgyang-song is *Lokayatin (the text
actually reads: 1o ka ayo tt), and that the opinion of some followers of Gtsang-
nag-pa that the term is rkyang pa ba ("one who [maintains) merely or solely") 18
thus incorrect. Glo-bo mkhan-chen apparently emended his text to read rkyang pa
ba (see also ibid., p. 261b.4) based on this understanding of the purvapakşd. See
also his Sde bdun mdo...phyoge snga, p. 14.4 (71.4) where he reads: lig rten ange
phyi mi dod pas rkyang pa ba'o zhes zer ba ni Isyang 'phen pa'i sgra don ma shes
par zad la. Here rkyang pan pa would seem more likely because it 1s closer
phonetically to the standard form.
Compare Dbus-pa Blo-gsal's treatment of the same problem (p. 65.3): de dag
Risgra'1 don nt lig rten pa'l yang dag pa'i Ita ba las gud du song bas na tayang
pan pa ste a yo ti ni song ba dang bral ba dana.gre boli don to zhes slob dpon

"dí kho ma la phan par dod pas rgyang [read: rkyang?] phan pa la soge par 'chad
pas ni rgyang pan pa'i sgra'i don mi shes par zad de/
Dbus-pa Blo-gsal (or his later scribes or editors) thus seem to have used
the spelling Rgyang-pan-pa, which seems to have been the preferred spelling for
other good scholars of the period as well. It is found for instance in Bu-ston,
Chos magon pa, p. 177.1 (wa 50.1), and also in KhJ (B). In the Derge edition of
the KhJ, however, the accepted spelling was Rgyang-'phen-pa.
The Sanskrit term lokayata has been interpreted as "concerning the world"
by E. Frauvallner (1973), vol. 2, p. 221, and as "found among people in general"
by S. N. Dasgupta (1951), vol. I, p. 78.
***Real Tire gzhung du smra be. This seems to be a reference to the
doctrines of statecraft taught by such persons as Canakya and Kautilya. However,
Shakya-uchog-Idan, Mkhas 'jug dris lan, p. 134.7, explains that this is a re-
ference to the "doctrine of the evil Kşatriya" (rgyal rigs ngan pa'l schung luga),



a phrase used in India for the defeating or suppressing of those who abide in
proper doctrines while oneselt abides in an improper religious system. He also
cites PV IV 63d (=PVin III 20d):
bya ba rgyal rigs lugs yin no
(Here the Sanskrit equivalent of rgyal rigs lugs is rajakulasthiti.) Shakya-
mchog-Idan explains that Dharmakirti used this phrase to refer to such an evil
system.
On this latter "Kpatriya tradition" see also KhJ II 30 (D p. 100.4.2 (tha
405.2]): rgyal po'i gra sa'i rnan gzhag dang/ rgyal rige kyi lugs rin no zhes bye
bo la soge pa ni rang mi ties pa la spyod' cing azhan mi rige pa byed petshar

See also the explanations of this system merely as unethical materialism in
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...phyogs snga, pp. 14.6-15.2 (76.6-8a.2).
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, pp. 263a.5-266b.6, took verses III 43-45 as a
point of departure for various comments and expansions, most of which have already
been mentioned in the previous notes. To summarize his commentary:
He begins with a quote from Lho-pa kun-mkhyen Rin-chen-dpal (from his
lable commentary on the BCA) in which Lho-pa would seem to be recording
Sa-pa's general teachings on the origin and nature of the five main non-Buddhist
philosophical schools of India:
(1) Sankhya (263b.4)
(2) *Vaidika (Mimamsa and Vedanta) (2640.3)
(3) Vaiseșika (264b.1)
(4) Jaina (264b.2)
(5) Carvāka (264b.3)
C. Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, p. 50.1, who denies that the Samkhya came first, thus
rejecting an interpretation of a line in Candrakirti's Madhyamakavatára. For more
discussion of this fivefold classification of the Tirthika schools, see D. Jackson
(1985), pp. 4ff.
Glo-bomkhan-chen next discusses the numbering of the non-Buddhist schools
as found in the Dbu na rin chen sgron na (described above, note 105). Next (p.
265a.1) he quotes from the commentary on Hevajra Mulatantra 1.x, 12 given in Grags-
pa-rgyal-mtshan's Rnam bahad dag ldan. There the Tantra is interpreted as indi-
cating the same five schools as in Lho-pa's list. Grags-pa-rgyal-nt shan's account
concludes with a suonary that reduces all the schools to 360, 63, 20, 5, 2, and 1.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen interprets this commentary as being in accord with the Khu.
Next (p. 265b.5) Glo-bo mkhan-chen asserts that just this classification of
the non-Buddhist schools into five main schools is found in other great basic



scriptures too. As an instance he quotes the closing lines of the Rigs gter:
thub, pa ser skya rkang mig pa dang tug pa'l bu//

Here the Nyāya and Vaiseșika are listed separately, while the Mima saka are
omitted. Shakya-mchog-Idan, Mkhas jug dris lan, p. 129.5, had already pointed
out this difference between the Rigs gter and EhJ to Glo-bo mkhan-chen. However,
in his subsequent Tshad ma rigs...rnam bshad, pp. 741.7-742.1, Shakya-uchog-Idan
described these as the "five schools of (non-Buddhist] dialecticians" (rtor se ade
Inge), though still identifying each correctly. The later scholar Ngag-dang-
chos-grags, Bod kyi mkhas, pp. 54€, in a gloss explained rkang mig pa as rig byed
24, thus only obfuscating the point. Here Ngag-dang-chos-grage may have been
following Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...phyors snge, p. 17.3 (9a.3) where this
passage is explained.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen (p. 266a.1) then goes on to mention the two ways in which
the Tirthika views may be summarized into one hundred in the Tarkajvalá (as listed
above in note 105). Then (p. 266b.2) he discusses the term Lokayata and its
Tibetan equivalent (see above, note 110). The final point he makes (p. 266b.3) is
to refer the reader to the following works for further clarifying analyses:
(1) The Tarkajvala of Bhavaviveka.
(2) The commentary on Bhavaviveka's Prajitāpradipa by Avalokitavrata (on which
see D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 67).
(3) The Dbum rin chen 'phreng ba (
D3901, the Madhyamakaratnamālā of
"Candrahari-pa"; could this be a mistake for the Dbu ma rin po che i srron
m ascribed to a Bhavaviveka? CE. number 5 below. But Glo-bo mkhan-chen,
Sde bdun mdo...phyoga anga, p. 12.5 [66.5] cites it in the same way.)
(4) The Lta ba'1 rab dbye of Atisa (not extant?).
(5) The "Madhyamaka treatise" of the ācārya Candrahari (probably his Ratna-
malā, D 3901, but cf. number 3 above).
(6) The treatise by Kamalabila famed as the "great authority" (?) (tshad
chen) (-probably his Panjika on the Tattvasapgraha).
(7) The Nyayabindu pūrvapakşasaqkşipta of Kamalasīla.

trinity.



***Cf. Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, Pp. 65.6-75.3. On p. 73.3 the Dbang-phyug-pa
(Alsvara Saiva) are said to include the Rigs-pa-can, Bye-brag-pa, Gsal-byed-pa,
and the Rna-ma-phug-pa. The Khyab-'jug-pa (Vaisnava) are said to include the
Tshanga-pa-ba, Dpyod-pa-ba, Rig-byed-pa, Brda-sprod-pa, Tsa-ra-ka-pa, Rgyal-dpog-
pa, and Gsang-ba-pa. At least, this is what "the masters explain" (slob Spon dag

the classification by Shakya-mchog-Idan, Obu ma rnam, vol. 15, pp. 429.5.

Bodhi bhadra in his JSSN states that the name Sautrantika has been given to
those who accept literally the text of such Sūtras as the Sanmukha and Bhadracarya
and who follow them. See K. Minaki (1976), pp. 196f, and D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981),

have not yet found an instance of the use of this term in another school.
The term stong pa nyid (Sünyata) was 'Indeed interpreted differently in
other schools. To cite an extreme example, Uddyotakara In his Nyāyavarttika III 1
denied that dunya had no denotation; rather, he held that it meant "fit for dogs"
and denoted any substance that was fit for dogs. See K. Potter (1977), pp. 327.
Elsewhere sünyata was understood in the more usual sense of mere emptiness or



voldness. See for example Samkara, Upadešasähasri II,18,125 and K. Potter (1981).

120Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, pp. 266b.6-283a.2, discusses and expands upon
III 46 at length. He gives background information on the classification of the
Buddhist schools, and also presents what amounts to a brie
of the four main schools with special emphasis on the Yogacara and Madhyamaka. He
begins by quoting Hevajra Tantra II,viii, 9-10 (see D. Snellgrove (1959), vol. 1,
p. 116). Then he quotes a verse from the JSS of a later Aryadeva (see K. Mimaki
[1976), P. 186). In this way he shows that the fourfold classification has
canonical authority. He also points out that the latter is also quoted in the
Vimalaprabha commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra.
He next (p. 267a.3) addresses a very interesting issue. By his time some
scholars had adopted a critical, historical approach to the Buddhist scriptures.
They had come to the conclusion that the four schools were established and named
subsequent to the Nirvana of the Buddha by different teachers according to their
own opinions, whereas during the Buddha's own lifetime there had been no such
classifications.
Globo mkhan-chen (p. 267.5) could not accept such a view because he
believed that in that case it would have been unfeasible for the Buddha to have
given these various teachings in accordance with the different mentalities of his
disciples. Moreover, this would contradict the statement by the Arya (Nagarjuna)
that the Buddha made doctrinal pronouncements which possessed a special intent
Sünyatāsaptati 44; see also Chr. Lindtner (1982), pp. 54£.):
yod ces pa yod med ces pa'ang/
yod de yod med de ang yod//
sangs rayas rnams kyis dgongs nas ni//
gsungs pa rtogs par sla ma yin//
Those Tibetan scholars who followed a historical approach moreover proposed the
following (p. 2675.2): After the Nirvana of the Buddha, the first scriptures to
appear were those of the Valbhāṣika school. Then there arose the tenets of the
Sautrāntika, and next the Madhyanaka. Then Arya Asanga established the tenets of



412
the Yogacara. For that reason one finds the tenets of the Vaibhāşika and Sau-
trantika appearing as pūrvapaksas in the basic writings of Nagarjuna, whereas the
latter does not take the tenets of the Yogācāra' as his purvapaksas and refute
them.
According to Glo-bo mkhan-chen (p. 2675.6) this too is untenable. He
points out that the Yogacarins are mentioned in the Bodhicittavivarana. (BV) of
Nagarjuna, quoting first verse 30 and then 31 (for these verses see also Chr.
Lindtner (1982), pp. 1948). He quotes in addition Yuktişaştika 12, as also quoted
in the auto-commentary on KhJ III 48. Glo-bo mkhan-chen interprets the "unvise
person" of the latter verse to be one who maintains the existence of a momentary
non-dual Gnosis, which is the very tradition of the Mind-Only.
Regarding the authorship of the Bv, see D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), p. 104.
Cf. Chr. Lindtner (1982), P. 11, who counts the BV among the twelve texts not
including the MMK-attributed to Nagarjuna that must be considered genuine. See
also 1bid., p. 122, note 149, and p. 180, and Chr. Lindtner (1982a), pp. 186ff.

The above account in the KhJNSh seems somewhat rough or hastily put
together. Nevertheless, it has passages of considerable interest, such as on the
division of the Dbu-ma into phra ba and rags pa (279a. 3-2801.3) attributed to
Atisa, and the long quote from the otherwise unavailable Geung sgros ma commentary
on the BCA by Lho-pa kun-mkhyen (281a,6-283a.2). The same attribution to Atisa is
made by Ngag-dbang-bsod-nams-rgyal-mtshan, Sdom pa gsum, 267.5 (134a.5). He here
mistakenly ascribes the Dbu ma rin po che'i sgronma (Madhyama karatnapradipato
Atisa, as Glo-bo mkhan-chen (and Lho-pa?) also did, if the mention of the title
was not the beginning of the quotation from Atisa.
I could not locate the rags pa/ phra ba distinction in Atisa's writings,
but one can compare his Dbu ma'i man ngag. (P), vol. 102, p. 55.2.7 with KhJNSh .
559.4 (279.4). As Mr. S. Matsumoto informed me, the passage attributed to Atisa
above quotes the Madhyamakaratnapradipa (P), tsha, 353a.3-4. This passage has
been discussed by S. Yamaguchi in his works, vol. 1, p. 313.
14. See NB III 59 and its commentary by Dharmottara (Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-
32), vol. 2, p. 172). Stcherbatsky, ibid., note 1, stated that "this is the
celebrated rule of Dignaga which lays down the fundamental principle that a philo-
sophical debate must have some common ground to start with. Neither the speaker
nor his opponent has the right of quoting facts or reasons that are not admitted
as real by the other party." In his Nirvāpa (1927), PP. 1188, Stcherbatsky
translates Candrakirti on the difficulties this rule caused for Madhyamikas. Cf.
K. Potter (1963), p. 67, where agreeing on an example of established subject is
described as a basic procedure for making progress in Indian debating in general.
1. One of the points that Sa-pan stressed in his teaching of Pramana was
that Dharmakirti when investigating material objects operated from the standpoint
of Sauträntika tenets, whereas when he negated external objects he adopted a
Yogācāra standpoint (on this approach of Dharmak Irti, see also S. Moriyama [1984],
p. 16 and note 27). In stressing this, Sa-pan was rejecting the procedure of
Phywa-pa and his followers. See above, chapter 7, and Shakya-nchog-Idan. Tahad ma
rigs...rnam bahad, p. 453. Sa-pan explained this in more detail in his RTRG, P.
170.1.4: phyl rol gyi don khas len pa na/ mdo ade pa'i luge azung bar bya'o/l,
etc. See also Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma rigs...Tham bahad, p. 468; and Go-rams-
pa, Sde bdun mdo, pp. 399.1 and 555.5.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh (pp. 273.6-273b.1) already quoted KhJ III 47.
and now (pp. 283.6-287.6) devotes considerable space to explaining it and its
autocommentary. According to his topic headings, this verse is the first part of
a main fourth section: de dag rtsod pa'i tshul (p. 283.27). According to the



415
topic headings he worked out (see also below, Appendix I), this first part con-
sists of the identification of Dharmakirti's intended meaning (chos kyi grags pa't
dgonge pengos bzung ba). Glo-bo mkhan-chen discerns four steps in Sa-pap's
autocommentary on this verse, which are four steps in a critical philosophical
analysis of entities:
(1) phyi rol svi don dgos pa'i dbang gis khas len pa'i tshul (283a.6)
(2) rigs pas dpyad nas de nyid 'sog pa'i tahul (285a.5)
(3) kun tu tha snyad pa'i gzhi mam ris bsgrub pa (285b.4)
(4) tha snyad las "das pa don dam la 'jug pali tshul (2860.6)
The comment on the first of these seems to consist of a quote from a PV commen
tary by Rong-ston Shes-bya-kun-rig (see 284b.3), though the beginning of the quote
is not clearly marked. The topic is the first section (skabs) of the discussion
of pramapaphala (tshad 'bras) in PV III 301-367. On this see also L. van der
Kuijp (1983), P. 287, note 182. Here Rong-ston quotes PS I Bcd, on which see M.
Hattori (1968), pp. 28 and 1827. Rong-ston--if he is the real author--considered
the lines
tshad ma nyid du 'dogs pa ste//
bya ba med palang me yin no/
to belong to the karikas, and they are found in PS (P), P. 25.2; see also K.
Mimaki (1979), note 14. On the tshad 'bras discussion in the PV, see also Go-
rams-pa, Rgyas pall, PP. 136.2.4-137.2.4. After this quote, Glo-bo mkhan-chen
(pp. 2845.4-285a.5) also applies the Sautrantika tenets to the third skabs of the
tshad 'bras Investigation, quoting PV III 341d and also RTRG, p. 230.1.2.
In a similar passage in the RTRG (p. 169.3.5), Sa-pan describes the purport
(dronge pe not of Dharmakirti but of the Buddha. (But this is presumably also
how Dharmakirti is supposed to have identified that intent.): bde bar sahega pa'i
luge bagrub pa la gnyia las dang po dgonga pa dngos bzung ban thub pas phyi

80/7. (The slob dpon of the last sentence is Dharmakirti.) See also below, note
144.
The Venerable Khenpo Appey here considered the possible emendation to
don syi mthus skyes la dra ba since D: don syi mthus skyes did not seem to make
good sense. In any case, the skyes la 'dra ba is definitely what is being
referred to in this passage. This is the second moment of cognition in Sautránti-
ka epistemology. The mind cognizes only this cognitive image that arises in



416
resemblance to the original object. According to the Sautrāntikas, this is not
the object itself, and there is an interval of one moment before the image 18
cognized (in contrast to the Vaibhaşikas who maintain the direct and immediate
perception of the object). See RTRG, P. 170.1.5: de dag tshogs pa las skad cig
gyis par rham shes kyi phyi rol yul ayi rnam pa 'dra bar skyes pa de nyid skyes
la 'dra ba'1 shes pa vin ro. See also Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad me riss...rnam
bshad, p. 646.6.
Glo-bokhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 2840.2 (a quote from Rong-ston?) defines the
gzung nam of the Sautrantikas as don dang 'dra bar skyes pa yul si rnan palo/l.
On the subsequent refutation of the skyes la 'dra ba by Dharmakirti, see PV III
323 and Go-rams-pa, Rgyas pa'i, p. 139.4.5. For more on Sauträntika epistemology,
see Jadunatha Sinha (1938), pp. 35-42.
124PV III 219. This verse is identical in the Tanjur version except that P
and N read spyod in lined, according to E. Steinkellner (1977), P. 152. This
verse is also quoted in RTRG, p. 169.3.5, and explained in RTRG, p. 221.1.4.
These lines are not found in Dharmakārti's main works, but are only
attributed to him by oral tradition. They are also quoted in RTRG, P. 170.2.6,
and Go-rams-pa, Sde bdun mdo, P. 399.3. In the Rigs gter rang grel, skas appears
instead of skabs.

1The reasoning of "absence of oneness and manyness" is one of the four or
five great reasons used by later Madhyamikas to establish the Madhyamaka theory of
dharmanairātmya. See below, note 155. But it was also used in many Mahayana
works. It is found for instance in:
Nāgår juna, RĀ, I 71
Vasubandhu, Viasatikā, 11ff.
Dignaga, Alambanapariksa 5
Dharmakirti, PV III 360 (cf. VN [P]. p. 37.a.6)
This reasoning vas elaborated especially by Srigupta, who made it the subject of
his Tattvavatāravrtti, and by Säntarakṣita, who discussed it in detail in his
Madhyamakālapkāra. It was also employed by Jñänagarbha, Kanalasila and Hari-
bhadra. Atisa was one of the later Madhyamikas who listed it as one of the four
(or five) great reasons used to establish their doctrine. See K. Mimaki (1982).
p. 212, note 547, and Chr. Lindtner (1981), p. 207. On this reasoning see also
Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. I, p. 514, and D. Seyfort Ruege (1981), p. 68 and
note 221.
Sa-pan. KTRG, p. 170.3.1-5, used the "absence of oneness and manyness"
reasoning to negate two distinct sorts of "constructions": (1) coarse substances
which constitute a "whole" which possesses sections or parts (roga pa yan lag can
By rdzas as accepted by the Vaideșikas, and (2) subtle "atoms" (apu) which are
supposedly impartite (phra mo cha med - rdul phran) as accepted by Sautrántikas
and some Tirthikas (e.g. the Vaiseșikas). The first is not simple or impartite
because it involves several parts and directions (or sides), 11ke a heap of rice.
The "atoms" too are not truly simple and impartite, for they involve six parts
(the six sides of spatial extension) just as a house does. Here Sa-pap quotes
Vasubandhu's Vimsatikā 12:
If an "atom" (paramapu) was conjoined with six (other atoms] simul-
taneously, it would have six parts [i.e. sides). If those six occupy
the same place (samanadesa), a physical object would also be just the
size of an "atom."
In addition, Sa-pap states that "atoms" are negated by critically investigating
whether one or a series of two of them have or lack spatial extension (ring thung
yod med). In this connection he then quotes PV III 360 (PVin I 51). See also Th.
Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. 1, pp. 191 and 519, note 2; L. de La Vallée Poussin
(1971), vol. 1, pp. 89f; and Y. Kajiyama (1976), p. 141, note 5.
Later in the RTRG (pp. 171.2.6 and 171.4.5), Sa-paņ as an interpreter of
Dharmakirti restricts the application of these critical negations to the coarse
and subtle substantial entities just described. He says these reasonings are here
not to be applied to nonentary impartite consciousness in the way that Madhyamikas



418
do. See also below, note 131.
1- This refers to the drug gis ecig char sbyar ba na (satkena yugapadyogat)
of Vimsatikā 12a. As mentioned in the previous note, Sa-pan, RTRG, p. 170.3.2,
used this reasoning to negate the notion of "atoms" (rdul phran - apu) and quoted
this verse of the Vimsatika. See also Mokşakaragupta 32 (Kajiyama (1966), PP.
145f), where the same verse is quoted.
130PY III 353b-d. The Tanjur version of this verse (following Miyasaka
[1971/72), p. 89):

Cf. Pin I 44-4, which is very similar. On this verse from the PV see T. Vetter
(1966), pp. 90€; and K. Mimaki (1979), p. 206, note 46, and (1980b), p. 160. The

***Rngog and his successors (including Phyva-pa) used the "absence of
oneness and manyness" reasoning of Dharmakirti to establish all knowable entities
as empty of own-natures, 1.e. they used it to establish the Madhyamaka. See
Shakya-mchog-Idan, Mkhas pa, p. 95.7: rngor lo [brsyud par. bcas. A dag... rnam

byed gcig dang du bral la 'chad pa dang/. See also Shakya-schog-Idan, ibid., pp.
23.2 and 30.5; and Springs yig. p. 324.5.
As mentioned above, note 128, Sa-paņ explains the gcis dang du bral rea-
soning of Dharmakirti also in RTRG, pp. 171.3.1 and 171.4.5. There he indicated
that Dharmakirti had in mind the negation of "objects" (yul - vibaya) of the
duality of apprehended object and apprehending subject (zung 'dzin - gråhya
grāhaka) but did not use this reasoning to criticize the notion of a momentary
impartite consciousness as the Mädhyamikas do. See also Shakya-mchoy-ldan, Dbu me
rnam, vol. 15, p. 376.4. But in the ThGS where he adopts the Madhyamaka



standpoint, he criticizes non-dual cognition as not being the ultimate because in
the last analysis it amounts to an entity. See Thos p. 31.3.4 (623.4).
This purvapakga begins the third of the four philosophical stages dealt
with by Sa-pap in his autocommentary: kun tu tha snyad pa'i gzhi rnam rig bagrub
pe. See below, note 144.

the Tanjur (P) [29] (775) ngu, pp. 180.8-1805.1, as quoted by K. Mimaki (1982),

The non-canonical translation follows the available Sanskrit

See ibid., p. 96, note 293.
There are two reasons or proofs used in the tradition of Dignaga and
Dharmakirti to establish vijiapti. See RTRG, p. 170.4.2: rnam par ris pa bagrub
pa ni kun tu tha snyad pa'i tshad ma dpyod pa na mdo mdzad pa dang rnam grel
ndzad pa'i Ljes su 'brang ngo/ de la gayis te
gsal dang lhan cig dnigs nges 'grub//
Thus the two proofs are:



420
(1) "illumination (sal ba = prakasa) and awareness (rig pa)"
(2) "the necessary concomitance (bges pa niyama) of things simultaneously
apprehended (lhan cig diga pa = sahopalambha)"
Sa-pan, ibid., explains the first as follows: The defining mark of cognition (shes
pa) is said to be 11lumination and awareness (sel zhing rig pa). And since it is
impossible for there to be an object of knowledge (shes bya) that does not possess
illumination and awareness, all objects of knowledge are established as the mind,
just as a cow is established [to be such) by its devlap (which is one of its
defining marks). [Cf. S. Matsumoto (1980), p. 273, note 2; and L. van der Kuijp
(1983), p. 311, note 335.]
Sa-pap then explains the second proof: Whatever things are necessarily
concomitant (nges. Rakhyab pa) through simultaneous apprehension are not some-
thing different. He gives as his example (from PVin I, T. Vetter (1966), p.
94.18-19) that a perceived patch of blue and the cognition that apprehends it are
necessarily concomitant through simultaneous apprehension, the implication being
that cognition and its object are one.
Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma rigs...nam bahad, P. 474, explains this rea-
soning: Through the necessary concomitance of simultaneous apprehension, (what-
ever] appears is established as not being a substantial entity different from
cognition. Whatever is necessarily concomitant through simultaneous apprehension
18 impossible to be different from cognition, as for example the appearance of two
moons and the cognition of those [moons are not different). The appearance as
blue, etc., and the cognition that apprehends it too are necessarily concomitant
as simultaneously apprehended.
Go-rams-pa, Sde bun ndo, p. 560.6, expresses the thesis of this reasoning
as follows: The sensory cognition (dbang shes) in which there appears something
as an object and that which at that same time appears as the object in it are one
and the same. He also explains the meaning of the proof according to the Rant
Than cig pa ni yul dus cis car du snang ba yin la/ dmise pa
ni "dzin pa yin langes pani khyab pa yin no. See also the discussion of this
reasoning in PV III 388 with its commentary by Go-rama-pa, Rgyas pa'i, p. 146.2.3,
and in Dbus-pa B1o-gaal, beginning on p. 900.2.
As Sa-pan asserted at the beginning of the above account (RTRG, P.
170.4.2), when one critically discerns the Pranaņa of transactional usage, one
should follow the author of the (Pramana) Sutra (1.e. Dignāga) and of the (Pra-
māņa) Värttika (1.e. Dharmakirti). Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma' mdep. 21,
points out that the above two reasonings are indeed peculiar to the Pranana
tradition of Dignāga and are not found in other systems, whereas the reasoning of
"absence of oneness and manyness" is employed in many other scriptural traditions.



Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. 1, p. 355, note 1, briefly mentioned the
sahopalambha-niyama, and translated it as "coextensiveness of existence and know-
ledge." J. Sinha (1938), pp. 27-29, termed it "the law of simultaneous apprehen-
sion, and on p. 282, "invariably simultaneous perception of cognition and ob-
jects." A. K. Chatterjee (1975), p. 232, called it "the availability of the
object along with its consciousness, thus refuting its independence." And S.
Matsumoto (1978), p. 969 (9), and (1980), p. 1, translated it as "the necessity of
being perceived together." In the latter study Matsumoto discusses the occurrence
of this reasoning in the Bāhyarthasiddhikarikā 65-82, Tattvasapsraha (and panika
2029-2030, the Pin and its commentary by Dharmottara, and the Anekantajayapataka
V by the Jaina scholar Haribhadra Süri.

Here begins the fourth of the four stages of philosophical analysis
dealt with in Sa-pap's autocommentary, according to KhJNSh, p. 286.5: tha snyad

quoted at length by Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...Inam bahad, pp. 47.48
(24a.4).

In Sanskrit:

See Y. Kajiyama (1976), pp. 136-140; D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 90, note 293; and
K. Mimaki (1982), pp. 237-239 and note 592. The translation of lines ab in the
latter is:
Après avoir dépassé le "rien que pensée", il doit dépasser la connais-
sance) sans apparence des deux, c.-à-d. d'objet et agent de cogni-
tion).
The translator there followed Kamalasīla's interpretations in the first Bhavana-
krama, 211.10–12: evap cittamatram atikramya tad api dvayanirabhasam yai jñānam
tad atikramet/
The version found in Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, P. 1106.4, 18 closer to the Khu
quote:
sems tsam las ni "das nas su//
snang ba sed la bzla bar bya//
K. Mimaki (1982), note 592, discusses the likelihood that the lines quoted by
Dbus-pa Blogsal were taken from a secondary source and not directly from the
Sutra. Indeed, for these two lines the text is identical to that found quoted in
Kamalasila's Mi. See (P), P. 171a; (D), p. 157a; and S. Moriyana (1984), pp.
29€, note 56.
A quite different version is found in KhJNSh, p. 279b.1:
sems tsam las ni "das gyur na//
snang ba med par gnas par 'gyur//
snang med gnas pa'i rnal 'byor pall



423
de yis theg pa chen po mthong//
This translation is imbedded in a quote from an unidentified work by Atisa, and it
was based on the Sanskrit reading sa instead of na.
Still another version is found in Shākya-nchog-ldan, Dbu ma rnam, vol. 14,
P. 433.4:
sems tsam las ni "das nas kyang//
snang ba med la shin tu 'da'//
snang med gnas pa'i rnal 'byor pa//
de yis theg pa chen po mthong/
Here Shakya-mchog-Idan interprets Santarakṣita as maintaining that the sems tsam
refers to the Roam-bden-pa, the stang med to the Rnam-brdzun-pa, and the thea pa
chen po mthong to the Dhu-ma-pa.

***Yuktişastika 12. The wording of the version in the Tanjur is different,
though the meaning is the same. See Chr. Lindtner (1982), pp. 106f:
dngos po shin tu phra ba la'ang//

zhus pa'i mdo), (D) pho, p. 230b.2-3; and (P) [33] (823), pu, p. 238.6:
rkyen las skyes pa gang yin de ma skyes//
de la skye ba ngo bo nyid kyis med //
skyen la rag las gang yin stong par ssungs//
stong nyid gang shes de ni bas yod palo//
Line 1 of P reads te instead of de. See K. Mimaki (1982), p. 225, note 572.



The version found in Dbus-pa Blo-gsal, p. 108.5-6, is the same as in the
KAJ except that the former reads stong par bshad in line three (KhJ! stong pa
nyid).
The edited Sanskrit in K. Mimaki (1982), p. 226, note 572, is:
yab pratyayair jāyati sa by ajāto
na tasya ut pada svabhāvo 'sti /
yah pratyayadinu sa dünya ukto
yah Sünyatag jānati so 'pramattab //
***Thus the Madhyanaka is the fourth and final main stage that the philo-
sophical analyses and dissolutions lead to in the autocommentary to KhJ III 47-48.
The four stages, as listed in KhJNSh, p. 283a, were:
(1) How external objects are accepted because of a special motive (phyi rol
kyl don dgos pa'1 dbang gis khas len po'i tshul) (p. 283.6)
(2) How those very external objects) are negated after critical examination
through reasoning (riga pas doyad nas de nyid 'gog pali tshul) (p. 285a.5)
(3) The establishment of vijñapti, the basis of transactional usage (kun tu
tha snyad pa'i gzhi rnam rig begrub pa (p. 285b.4)
(4) How to enter into the ultimate truth, which has transcended transactional
usage (the snyad las dos pa don dam la fus patobul) (p. 2860.6)
Glo-bo mkhan-chen considered the subject of KAJ III 47-48 to be the identification
of Dharmakirti's intended meaning or purport (chos ky graga pa'i dgonga pa nros
bzung ba), and thus he understood Sa-pan to be identifying Dharmakirti as a
Madhyamika. This seems all the more justified by the last sentence of the auto-
commentary. But in a parallel passage of the Rigs ter rang grel (p. 169.3.5),
Sa-pap's subject was "to identify the intent" (of the Buddha) and to described how
the Xcărya (1.e. Dharmakirti) systematically established that intent (slobdpon
gyis 11 ltar atan la phab pa'l tshul). See above, note 122.
Go-rans-pa, Sde bdun mdo, PP. 398.6-399.1, interprets the above passage of
the Rigs gter rang grel as above, beginning his explanation of "the identifica-
tion of the intent" with the words bde bargshegs pas ("the Sugata (maintained]")
where the Rige ter rang Irel has thub pas ("the Munt (maintained]"). He ex-
plained the second part, the systematic establishment of the intent, beginning.
"Thus from among the four Buddhist philosophical tenets, if you ask which did the
Xcārya establish ..." (de Itar sangs rgyas pali grub mthal bzhi las/ slob dpon
syis Rang atan la dbab pa vin zhe na). And in the following passages of the Rigs
gter rang'grel Sa-paŋ states that Dharmakirti adopted Sautrántika and Yogacara
tenets. Here Sa-pap did not mention Dharmakirti as following the Madhyamaka. Cf.
the DS, p. 315.1.2, regarding the Buddha's purport (dgonge po):



de la 'fig rten mthun jug la//
dgongs nas phyl rol don du gsungs//
tha snyad dpyod pa'i rigs pa la//
dgongs nas chos rhams sems su gsungs//
dam pa'i don la dgonga nas ni//
chos kun spros pa bral zhes Asungs//
Dharnakirti himself in PV III 195-213 and 301-367 also engaged in step-by-
step critical analyses of this sort. See L. van der Kuijp (1983), p. 272, note 99
and p. 277, note 123; and T. Vetter (1964), pp. 67-71. In his Rigs gter rang
grel Sa-pap interpreted these ontological dissolutions as ending with the Nirākā
m med and did not go on to the establishment of the paramartha
of the Madhyamaka.
In the Khy, however, Sa-pap used a gradual series of negations (bkag pa'i
rin pa to lead through the Saut rantika and Yogacara to the final view, the
Madhyamaka (see above, chapter 7). In so doing he was following a procedure that
was well established among the Indian Madhyamikas of the Yogăcăra-Madhyamaka. Go-
rams-pa, Royal ba, pp. 27€ (ca, pp. 140.5-146.6) spoke of such procedures as
forming two of three methods by which the Madhyamaka could be established in the
minds of those who had been trained in philosophical tenets. The three methods
were:
(1) Where a student reaches (on his own?] the higher philosophical
tenets of the four Buddhist schools by hearing explanations of the
reasons through which the relatively higher schools criticize what
the schools beneath the maintain as their ultimate real.
(2) Where the teacher, who is a Madhyamika, applies the student in the
end to the Madhyamaka after criticizing those who maintain the exis-
tence of entities according to the non-Buddhist and lower Buddhist
schools, by stating the reasons which the relatively higher schools
use to disprove the relatively lower schools.
(3) Where a Madhyamika teacher applies the student in the end to the
Madhyamaka tenets by stating the criticisms of the lower schools
according to the Madhyamaka tradition itself (1.e. using the rea-
soning that is peculiar to the Madhyamaka),
According to Go-rams-pa, the sequence of argumentation in the second method is:
(a) Refutation of the Vaibhāṣika tenets through Sautrintika reasoning
(b) Refutation of the Sautrántika opinion of a really existent "atom"
through the reasoning of "simultaneous combination of six"
(c) The refutation of the opinion of the Yogacärin that mind is really
existent, by means of the reasoning of "devoid of oneness and



426
manyness"
Go-rams-pa later (pp. 298f) quotes the lines from BCA IX 4:
rnal 'byor pa yang blo khyad kyis//
gong ma gong ma rnams kyis gnod//
And he discusses the step-by-step refutation of lower tenets by higher as being
"like the reasoning taught in the JSS" (ye shes snying po kun las btus las bahad
pa'i rige pa Ita bu). Still later in the same work (p. 337), Go-rams-pa mentions
two Madhyamaka works that adopted such a procedure of sequential refutation of
tenets: the BV attributed to Nagarjuna and the JSS attributed to an Kryadeva.
Here the negations begin with the "self" imputed by non-Buddhists and end with the
non-dual consciousness (advaya jñāna) of the Yogācāra. Cf. Shakya-mchog-ldan, Dbu
ma rnam, vol. 14, pp. 433.2, 437.1ff and 587.6; and vol. 15, pp. 381.6f and 468.
Perhaps the earliest Indian Buddhist source for such a series of refuta-
tions is the Lankavatāra Sutra X 256-258, and indeed Sa-pan did quote from this in
his autocommentary. See also above, note 140. Later Indian "Yogacara-Madhyani-
kas" commonly took this Sitra as their basis for first refuting external objects
through Cittamātra reasoning and finally refuting the notions of a really existent
mind as held by the Yogăcărins. Those who are known to have followed such a
method include:
(1) Jñanagarbha (f1. mid-8th c.) in his Satyadvayavibhahga. See M. Ichigo
(1985).
(2) Santarakṣita (fl. late-8th c.) in his MA 92-93. See Y. Kaiyaina (1976),
p. 132, and D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 90. (See also Shakya-nchog-Idan,
Dbu ma rnam, vol. 14, pp. 433.)
(3) Kamalasila (1. late-8th to early-9th c.?) in his Bhavanakrama (Skt. P.
210.9-14), on which see K. Mimaki (1982), p. 238, note 592; and Y. Kajiyama
(1976), pp. 133-140. And also in Kamalasila's Madhyamakãloka, as cited by
D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), pp. 95f, and S. Moriyama (1984), pp. 29€.
(4) Vidyakaraprabha (fl. c. 800?) in his Madhyamakanayasarasamäsa. See D.
Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 99.
(5) Jitāri (c. 1000?) in his Sugatamatavibhaga kärikäs and Bhagya, which is
directly linked to the JSS. See D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), p. 100 and note
312.
(6) Mokşākaragupta (late-11th or 12th c.) in his Tarkabhāşa, a manual of
Buddhist logic and philosophy. See Y. Kajiyama (1966), pp. 139-148.
Ratnakarasanti (e. 1000) of the "Vijnapti-Madhyamaka" in his commentary on the
Madhyamakālapkāra also interprets the stages of understanding taught in the Lanka-
vatara Sutra as four stages of Yogacara. See D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), pp. 122.
Cf. the similar approach of Haribhadra of the Madhyamaka-Prajaparamita synthesis



as described by S. Moriyama (1984), pp. 33ff, and by Shakyo-nchog-Idan, Dby me
rnam, vol. 14, p. 434.6. Atisa Dipankarasrijfiana is also said to have followed
such a method. See the quote in KhJNSH, P. 279a.3, from an unidentified work
attributed to him, and also the discussion above, note 120, end.
Sa-pap and Sa-skya-pa tradition accept the establishment of all appearances
as mind (shang ba sems su sgrub pa as a useful propaedeutic to the meditative
realization of the Madhyamaka view. Some Dge-lugs-pa critics rejected this
stage because for them it smacked of the Yogācāra. Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSH, P.
2800.4, replied to such critics by quoting Candrakirti(päda?) and Atida against
them, and then saying: gang dag snang ba sems su khas blangs pas sems tsa

(P), vol. 102, p. 55.2.7: thams cad rang di sens sgyu ma'i....
Some later Dge-lugs-pa scholars identified the above procedure as a point
of similarity between various early Tibetan masters (including Mar-pa and Bu-ston)
and the Yogacara-Madhyamikas such as Santarakṣita and Kamalasila. See D. Seyfort
Ruegs (1966), P. 12, and note 1. Cf. Sum-pa mkhan-po Ye-shes-dpal-'byor. Dpas

***Sa-pan when directly expounding in his Rigs ster rangerel the Pranāņa
doctrines of Dharmakirti did not state that the latter considered vijñapti a
steppingstone to the Madhyamaka or even that Dharmakirti explicated the Madhyataka
at all. See above, chapter 7. But Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 287a.1, held
that in the opinion of Sa-pan, "The ultimate intent explicated by Dharmakirti in
his Pramāpavarttika was just the Madhyamaka that accords with the traditions of
Arya Nögarjuna." In this Glo-bo mkhan-chen goes against the prevailing Sa-skya-pa
tradition as represented by both Go-rams-pa and Shakya-nchog-ldan, and even
against his own earlier commentary on the Rigs gter. But he no doubt felt justi-
fied in his interpretation by the words of the Khu itselt.
As discussed above in chapter 7, the interpretation of Dharmakirti as a
Madhyamika was the old tradition of Rngos and his successors, and Glo-bo mkhan-
chen states that Sa-pay here was in agreement with that great translator. Rngog's
tradition derives from the teachings of Indian scholars such as Prajñäkaragupta,



428
the author of the Pramäpalankára. (Another later Indian scholar of this persua-
sion was Jitari [fl. c. 1000?], who attempted in his Sugatamatavibhansa Bhagya to
show that Dharmakirti was a Madhyamika who was in agreement with Nagarjuna. See
D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981), p. 100.) Earlier in his Rigs gtercommentary (Sde bdun
mdo...rnam bahad, pp. 47-70 [24a-35b]). Glo-bo mkhan-chen himself had staunchly
denied this interpretation, and in this connection had discussed also Prajtákara-
gupta's interpretations.
*** dngos po stobs zhugs - vastubalapravítta. The Venerable Khenpo Appey
explained this term as "reasoning which is connected with real factor which
possesses proof while lacking disproof" (don dang 'brel ba'am sgrub byed yod cing
anod byed med pa'l riga pa). The first sense (don dans 'brel ba) indicates that
logical reasoning of this sort must have a correspondence to real things. But
even though the intentional objects of inference are real things (RTRG, P.
251.3.5: Efes dpag gi yul dngos po yin), an inference as verbally expressed or
thought entails a mistaking of the meaning of the words to be the really existent
particular (svalaksana, the object of pratyakşa). See RTRG, pp. 247.2.6 and
248.2.1. Cf. KhJ I 31, autocommentary (D p. 84.2.6) and KhJ I 35 (D p. 84.4.1).
The real correspondence between word or thought and its referent, according to
this system, is indirect. It is a function of "exclusion of other" (anyapoha),
which is the conceptual apprehension of a "universal" (samanyartha). Cf. KIJI
35b (D p. 84.3.6 (tha 170a.6]): spyi "dzin pa ni szhan sel yin.
In the Naiyayika tradition, the actual existence of the subject of an
inference was a strict requirement. See S. Mookerjee (1935), P. 408, and K.
Potter (1977), p. 204. (On the subject or locus (paksa) of Indian inferences, see
also J. F. Staal (1973] and K. Potter (1963), p. 66.) And for both Buddhist and
non-Buddhist logician alike, the inferential relation, i.e. "pervasion" (khyab pa
: wapti) too had to be founded upon true facts. See E. Steinkellner (1974), p.
120, note 9.
In the Buddhist logic of Dharmakirti,"objectively grounded" was one of
three types of sound reasons (rtaga yang dag) in inference
(1) dngos po atobs zhugs kyi rtas yang da,
(2) yid ches pa'i rtags yang dag
(3) grage pa'i rtags yang dag
The latter two can be classified as a single type for they depend on human accep-
tance and not on objective fact for their validation or grounding. See RTRG, P.
247.4.4: Cles dpag la stage, ki khyab pa khas blange dang dngos po stobs shuga
gayis sol dang po la'ang rang gis khas blangs dang/ thams cad kyis khas blange
payis su phye bas s9/. (Sa-pap based this account on PV IV 93.) See also Go-



rams-pa, Sde bdun mdo, . 603.4.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...rnam bshad, pp. 354.6-355.1 (1775.6-
178.1), gives a clear and succinct definition of dngos postobs xhurs when
differentiating the two types of sound reasons: don la gnas pa Itar blos bzung
zhing blos bzung ba ltar don la fug pa ni dngos stoba/ don la mi. anas kyang 'dod
pa rkyang pas sbyar ba ni gags pa vin te/.
A correct reason that is objectively grounded is necessary for an inference
that is concerned with "slightly hidden objects" (cung zad Ikox syur). And this
ultimately is based on direct perception (see Shākya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma
rigs...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 98.4). The other type of inference is concerned with
"completely hidden objects" (shin tu lkoggyur) and it has as its sound reasons
the two remaining ones in the above list. Thus inference can be classified as
twofold:
(1) dngos po stobs zhugs kyi rjes dpag
(2) yid ches pa'l rjes dpag
See Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma rigs...dgongs, vol. 10, pp. 33.7-34.1; Tshad ma
rigs... rnam bahad, pp. 694.7-695.2, and 696.5; and Go-rams-pa, Sde bdun mdo, .
631.
In a sound reason that is given by objective grounding, the connection
between the reason and predicate can be said to be an "objectively grounded
relation." See Shakya-mchog-ldan, Tshad ma rigs...dongs, vol. 9, p. 520: Szhan
yang digos postobs zhugs kyi rtags yang dag gi rtags chosenyis kyi brel pa la
dngos po stobs zhuge kyl 'brel pa dang/ grags vid kyi stoga chos kyis [?] 'brel
pa la sero base pali brel pa zhes bya ba 'di yang nges par grub payin no//.
The term "objectively grounded" is also applied by Sa-paņ on occasion to
the connection between words and their referents (RTRG, P. 251.1.2), to scripture
(RTRG, p. 249.2.2), as well as to means of knowledge (pramana) themselves (RTRG,
pp. 246.4.6-247.1.1). Direct perception too is gained by objective grounding:
mngon sum rjes dpag dngos stobs kyi//
tshad yin khas blangs grags pa gnyis//
sgro btage yin phyir khongs su (p. 247.1) badus//
mingon sum dans les dpag gnyis dngos po stobs zhugs kyis baal bayin la khas.
blang dang grans pa anyis ni.... Cf. Tsong-kha-pa, Lam rim chen mo, p. 435b,
as translated by D. Seyfort Ruegg (1983), p. 229: "an objectively gained pramana."
A dngos postoba zhugs kyi tshad ma may also be opposed to a tha anyad kyt. tshad
ma. See Go-rams-pa, Rgyal ba, p. 242.4.
Sometimes Sa-pap uses the term "objectively grounded reasoning" in opposi-
tion to "fallacious reasoning" (riga pa Itar snang). See his Skyes bu dan pa, p.
333.2.6: dngos postoba zhuga kyi rigs pa dang misal na/ rias paltar enang



430
dang 'gal yang si skyon/. See also his Lung rige, p. 334.1.4:

rige pa ltar snang anying po med//
The term vastubalapravſtta has been variously translated. Th. Stcherbatsky
(1930-32), vol. 2, P. 157: "the weight of real facts." A. Wayman (1978), notes
241 and 260: "authority aroused by strength of a present fact." Lati Rinbochay
and E. Napper (1980): "the power of the fact" (dngos stobs). And K. Mimaki
(1982), p. 178: "mus par la force des choses réelles." D. Seyfort Ruegg (1983),
P. 229, elucidated the term as follows: "Inferential knowledge may be gained by
objective validation (vastubala) and by consensual validation through convention
or authority." The latter also mentioned the occurence of vaatubala in PV I 65
and 130, III 45 and 185, and in Kamalasila's TS Panjika 1395. One should also
note that the relation of vastubala to scripture is discussed in PV IV 2, 48-51b
and 98-101b. See Go-rams-pa, Rgyas pa'i, pp. 161.3.4, 167.1.3, and 173.1.6.
On the different theories of grounding or validity of judgments in Indian
philosophy--whether "external," "internal," or both--see K. Potter (1977), pp.
158ff.
KAJ III 49 is quoted by Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...rnambshad, p.
35.6 (182.6).
19 This is a tenet of the later Nyāya-Vaiseşika. Uddyotakara (1. c. 650)
in his Nyayavarttika 1, 1,4, for instance, described six types of connection be-
tween sense object and sense organ. See G. Jha (1983), pp. 118ff. One is "con-
tact" (samyoga phrad pa) and four of the other five are types of "inherence"
(samavāya : "phrod pa 'du ba). One of the latter is sayuktasamavaya, on which
see K. Potter (1977), P. 307: "Inherence is (read: in) that which is in
contact, .. . 0.8., when we see the color of a jar, the color inheres in the
jar which is in contact with the visual organ." See also ibid., p. 162.
(According to Sridhara, however, the Vaidesika do not uphold the common sensical
notion of contact, as Professor K. Potter informed me.)
Sa-pan, RTRG, P. 229.3.5, discusses this model of sensory cognition: rigls)

dngos po - vastu. This is to be understood here according to the
Sautrantika as a momentary, efficacious entity. Something that is permanent and
unchangeable cannot be efficacious; hence it is not a really existent entity. See
Madhyamakalapkāra 8, and PV I 211 (on the link between the MA and PV at this point

* Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSI, p. 272.1, in his exposition of Yogacara
tenets Identified this purvapakşa as the opinion of "early Tibetan teachers of
Abhidharma" (bod anga rabs kyi mngon pa sara ba dag). Abhidharma and Vinaya were
the only scholastic subjects systematically studied and taught in 11th-century
Tibet prior to the founding of Atisa's and Rngog Blo-ldan-shes-rab's respective
schools. The early scholars of Abhidharma alluded to perhaps belonged to the
lineage of AS (and Koba?) studies which persisted in Tibet since the late-8th
century, the time of the great translators Ka-ba Dpal-brtsegs, Lcog-ro Klu't-
rgyal-mtshan, and Zhang Ye-shes-sde. Shakya-mchog-Idan, Dam pa'i chos mngon, p.
389, records this lineage and his place in it. Or those early scholars belonged
to the lineage of Ak studies established in 10th-century Tibet by the Indian
pandita SmrtiSrijana. On these Abhidharma lineages see also Kong-aprul, Thes
pa'i. sgo, pp. 440.76€ (om 143a.7).
The topic of this verse was already discussed by Grags-pa-rgyal-mtshan in
his Rayud kyi mungon par rtogs pa rin po che' lon shing, and Glo-bo mkhan-chen,
KhJNSh, . 273.1, briefly quotes from there: sems tsam yin na phyl rol syi don
khas blangs zhes pagal ba'i phyir ro. See also the commentary proper in KhJNSH,



432
p. 287b.5.
The opinions of Graga-pa-rgyal-mtshan and Sa-paņ on this point are also
discussed at greater length by Glo-bo mkhan-chen in'his Sa skyar bdag chen chos
rje'i dris lan mdzad pa (Toyo Bunko MS, cha, pp. 1916.3-197.5), a number of
replies to questions put by Sa-skya lo-tsa-ba "Jam-dbyanga-kun-dga'-bsod-nams,
written at Thub-bstan-dar-rgyas-gling on the 8th day of the sixth lunar month of a
monkey year (1512 or 1524). The sixth question is on this topic, and Glo-bo
mkhan-chen's reply begins on p. 1945.4. To begin his answer, Glo-bo mchan-chen
quotes KhJ III 50 with its autocommentary. Several early and later Tibetan
scholars apparently interpreted Grags-pa-rgyal-at shan's remarks to mean that the
AS must therefore be an exclusively Sautrántika scripture. Glo-bo mkhan-chen (p.
1950.2) observes that there exist scriptures in which more than one system of
tenets are taught in different sections, such as the PV of Dharmakirti and the
AKBhof Vasubandhu. Indeed, there are no basic treatises available in Tibetan
translation in which the Sauträntika tenets are set forth independently and in
their own right (rang rkang tahugs pa), he says. Those critics thought that Rje-
btsun Grags-pa-rgyal-mtshan did not understand the final purport of the scrip
tures, but in Glo-bo mkhan-chen's opinion they were indulging in controversy on a
flimsy basis--their supposition that slight textual corruptions in Grags-pa-rgyal-
mtshan's works Indicated a real error on Graga-pa-rgyal-mtshan's part.
15 See above, note 128. KhJ III 51 is quoted by Glo-bokhan-chen, Sde
bdun mdo...rnam bahad, p. 36.1 (186.1).
153 See above, note 135.
15 The correct reading is probably rig pa'i gtan tohtge. Here rig pa'i
gtan tshigs is equivalent to gsal zhing rig pa'i rtags. cf. Pvin I, (T. Vetter
[1966), p. 100.1-3, also quoted in S. Matsumoto (1980), p. 26, note 3): lhan cis
oa dang rig pa dag gis phyl rol svi don yod kyang angon po la soge pa snang

These two belong to the four or five) "great reasons" (gtan tahiga chen
po used to establish an understanding that all factors of existence (dharma) are
insubstantial. They are treated in the Bodhimirgadipaka commentary attributed to
Atida. As described by D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 112, these are:
(1) the reason' analyzing the (supposed) production of a product;



433
(11) the so-called "Vajrakaga-'reason' (rdo reszegs m'1 gtan chigs ana-
lysing origination from any of the causes postulated in the frame of the
catuskoti by either non-Buddhists (e.g. Isvara, puruga, avabhava, the
gupas, Brahman, Vişnu, Mahadeva) or Buddhist (e.g. the Abhidharnika's six
hetus and four pratyayas;
(111) the reason analysing things as devoid of both a single and multiple
nature; and
(iv) the reason' constituted by origination in dependence (pratityasamut-
pada) establishing Sunyata.

1 The full name of this reasoning is rayu mtshan mtshunga pall mosnyome
"parity (or logical balancing) of the same reasoning." This is one of four
reasonings used by Prasangikas which together constitute for them "inference"
(anumana), one of the four means of knowledge (pramapa) that establish the ulti-
mate truth (don dan sgrub byed kyi tshad ma bzhi). The four pranigas are:



(1) mngon sum : pratyaksa
(2) rjes dpag : anumana
(3) lung: agama
(4) dpe nyer al ba: upamana
See Go-rams-pa, Royal ba, pp. 266ff (cap. 133b). The pramapa of inference is
there defined as knowledge that has arisen from a non-nistaken understanding
regarding the relation between] the logical mark and the thing to be proven, and
which has a "hidden object" as its subject (jes su dpag pali tshad ma ni Ikog tu
Ryur ba'i yul can rtags bagrub par bya ba la mi "khrul pa las skyes pa'i shes pa).
As mentioned above, the four reasonings of the Präsangika's inference areas
follows:
(1) gal ba br fod pa't thal 'syur
(2) szhan la grags pa'i rjes dpag
(3) gyu stshan stshungs pa'1 mgo snyoms
(4) sgrub byed begrub bya dang, mtshunge pa'i ma grupa
Go-rams-pa, Bgyal ba, p. 267.2 (ca 1343.2) interprets the PP as teaching the
following with regard to the first two:
(1) [This 18) an adducing of a logical consequence which states something
that contradicts [the opponent's position] (gal ba brjod pa'i thal 'gyur). It is
used 1f a mere elicitation of a logical consequence (thal syur : prasanga) which
indicates a contradiction is able to remove the erroneous idea of the opponent.
For instance, as when proving that "birth" cannot be meaningfully predicated to an
entity "self," the reason being its existence as a permanent) "self." [It 18
nonsensical to predicate birth to something that is permanent.) Go-rans-pa
earlier (ibid., p. 28 (ca 146]) explained that this reasoning can be used against
such opponents as the Samkhya adherent who maintains the birth of a self and the
Jaina who maintains both "self" and "other."
(2) Inference which is accepted by others (zhan la graga, pa'i rjes pag).
This is where one starts with the statement of a contradictory logical consequence
as described above, and adds to it further elements of a formal argument, even
going so far as to state the full five branches of the traditional Indian argument
.fora.
(3) Balancing of the same reason toyu mtshan at shunga pa'i mgo snyoms).
This is a reasoning used against someone who maintains that even though a reason
(rgyu mtshan hetu) is the same, the conclusions it leads to (Ryu mtshan can
are dissimilar. Here the Mädhyamika argues by a logical "balancing" (1.e. analo-
gous reasoning) that the conclusions led to are the same. In general, there are
two ways of answering an objection: (a) directly, with the actual reply (lan real
me), and (6) Indirectly, through "balancing" or a parity of reasoning (mgo anyons



or mga bagre). For instances of these two see Sa-pan, Thus, pp. 5.3.6-4.1 (D
109.6-10b.1), and Shakya-mchog-Idan, Dbu ma rnam, vol. 15, PP. 595.2, 603.1.
Go-rama-pa states that the earlier master Gtsang-nag-pa classified the rayu
mtshan mtshunge pa't mgo snyoms into the following three types (which are not
clear to me):
(a) tog 80'1 mgo anyoms ("the balancing argumentation of dialectics"?).
This is said to be a negation of the opponent's position by means of a
similarity in there existing a reason accepted in pragmatic usage tha
snyad kyi toyu mtshan yod par atshungs pas deal pa).
(b) thod real gyi mgo snyoms ("balancing argumentation which does not follow
the normal sequence" ?) This is said to be a negation by means of the
similarity in there not existing a sound reason (yang dos pa'rayun (read:
rayu atshan) med par atshunga pas dgag pa).
(c) spyk ldog gcig pa yin pas dgag pa ("negation by its being the same
general concept"?). [On this type see also Shakya-mchog-idan, Dbu ma rnam,
vol. 15, p. 406.1.)
Go-rams-po above (Ibid., p. 28 (ca 14b]) mentioned that the ray stahan ntshunge
pa'i mosnyoms 18 used for instance against fellow Buddhists who maintain the
birth of an entity that is different (from what gives rise to it) and against non-
Buddhists such as Jainas who maintain both "self" and "other," and Lokayata ad-
herents who maintain the birth of something in the absence of a cause.
Another discussion of this reasoning is found in Tsong-kha-pa's lam rim
chen mo, p. 250, where according to the Mchan bzhi sbraga mu, pp. 474f, the system
of Khu lo-tsi-ba is the purvapaksa. For still other discussions, see K. Mimaki
(1982), p. 176, note 478.
(4) The fourth Prasangika reasoning is called sgrub byed bagrubbya dang
mtshunga pa'i merub pa "the probans being unestablished 11ke the probandum."
See KhJ III 64 and below, note 211.
For a classification of these four Prasangika reasonings ascribed to Pa-
tshab's disciple Zhang Thang-sag-pa, see Shakya-achog-ldan, Dbu ma rnan, vol. 15,

13 Here Sawpap holds that the Prasangika reasonings are vaatubalapravrtta.
According to Jan-dbyangs-buhad-pa in his Grub tha' chen mo, Pa-tshab lo-tsa-ba
held that the key difference between Svātantrikas and Prasangikas was that the
Svātanteikas accepted a sound means of knowledge given by objective grounding



(dngos postos hugs kyi tshad ma whereas the Prāsangikas did not. The passage
from the Grub mtha chen mo, ca, p. 746.5-7 (as quoted in K. Mimaki (1982), p. 45,

Tsong-kha-pa, Las rim chen mo, p. 436b, describes as his fourth purvapakea
an early Tibetan Madhyamika (apparently one of the Rma-bya-bas) who held that the
correct procedure was to negate objectively gained prampas and establish ultimate
reality by means of pramana recognized in everyday consensus, which he accepts in
pragmatic usage. See also D. Seyfort Ruegs (1983), pp. 229€, and note 68. The
scholar "Rma-by-ba chen-po" is also referred to by Go-rams-pa as having held that
the Madhyamika does not maintain any such dngos. Po stobe zhuse kyi tahad mo.
(This was perhaps Rma-bya Byang-chub-brtson-'grus being referred to here. Rmabya
Byang-chub-ye-shes is specified by Go-rams-pa in Royal ba, P. 153.4 (ca 77.4),
but compare Go-rama-pa, ta ba'i shan 'byed, p. 431.5 (ca 2160.5) where Rmabya
Byang-chub-brtson-'grus is the only Rma-bya-ba mentioned.) See Go-rama-pa, Royal

Later (p. 209.5) Go-rams-pa sums up a similar discussion by saying that sa-

here, if not the KhJ.



Go-rams-pa mentions Roma-bya-ba again, ibid., p. 242.4: rma byas chos can
tha snyad pa'i tshad mas grub kyang dngos po stobs zhugs kyi tshad mas ma grub pas
rang gyud du mi syur bar bshad palang...." See also below, note 169.
On Rms-bya-ba Byang-chub-brtson-'grus and his later critics. see now P.
Williams (1985). That Rma-bya Byang-chub-brtson-grus was the direct disciple of
Pa-tshab would seem to be Indicated by Shakya-mchog-ldan, Dbum rnam, vol. 15, P.
482.4, where he quotes from the work Pa tahab le tsa bali saung abu ma pa chen po
byang chub brtson 'grus kyi br jed byang du bkod pazhes bya ba'i batan bcos. But
according to Mkhas-grub-rje's gsan yig, Byang-chub-brtson-'grus belonged to the
subsequent generation. See D. Jackson (1985), p. 31, note 33, and also D.
Seyfort Ruegs (1983), p. 230, note 68.
13610-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 288a.4, identifies the pūrvapaksa here as
the system of Phywa-pa: "angs can si rigs pa smra ba chen po slobdpon phywa.
pa'i lugs."
Cf. Dharmottara's commentary on NB III 46 (Th. Stcher batsky (1930-32), vol.
2, p. 157):
Should not a logical argument (linga - "logical mark, reason") dio-
regard all established doctrines and be guided exclusively by the
weight of real facts? Therefore a philosopher should never take his
stand on a body of established doctrines, since they must be left out
of account? (56.20) Quite right! But, as a matter of fact, even in
those cases when (a philosopher) selfreliantly takes his stand on a
body of established doctrines, i.e. if he is an adherent of a definite
system (and) quotes arguments in accordance with that system), never-
theless only that proposition will represent his thesis which he him
self chooses to advocate (at a given occasion)."
On the relation of scripture (lung : agama) to reasoning that has objective
grounding (dngos stobs), see RTRG, P. 246.2.6: de la'ang dngos postobs zhugs kyi
rige palung la miltos la/ gnas gsum per 'pho ba na rigs pa dang ni gal ball
lung len pa't phyir rol. And RTRG, p. 249.2.2: Angos postoba zhugs kyis grub
pa'1 lung rnama ni rang tshig dang khyad par med pas....
Some (Tibetans?) seem to have held that logical marks accepted by oneself
(1.e. from the scripture of one's tradition, yid ches pa'i rtags) and accepted by
everyone (1.e. from worldly consensus, grags pa'i rtags) are also given by objec
tive grounding. See Sa-pan, RTRG, p. 248.1.2, where he rejected this.

Cf. the Mahayanasamgraha (G. Nagao ed., p. 70), II. 14A, where similar reasoning
is used to refute the existence of objects.
10 The words byas yod should be understood as byas pa'am yod pa "made" or
"existent"). See for instance the RTRG, p. 194.2.6: byas yod dang ml rtag pa gcig
gang gis grub cena/. and p. 194.3.3: yod pa'am byas pa ang bkod kyang rung

because the existence of the entity (dharnin)... is itself not established."

same quote occurs in the Thus, p. 32.1.2 (63a.2). dmiga su yod pa is perhaps upa-

The canonical version, P [108] (5521), phi 116.3 (p. 6.5.3); and D (4020), phi
1570.5 (p. 79.1.5), is identical except that Dreads 'thob in 11ne d. cf. the
translations of S. Lévi (1911), p. 80, and R. A. F. Thurman et al. (1979), p. 89.
The latter also includes the brief explanations of the commentary ascribed to
Vasubandhu, for which see also D phi 157a.5. See also the commentaries Rgyal-sras
Thogs-med-bzang-po, Theg pa chen, p. 165, and Mi-pham-rgya-mtsho, Theg pechen,
pp. 163ff. The Tibetan translation and commentaries are clear that the number is
1,200. C. S. Lévi (1911), p. 80, note 41.1, who perhaps misread or misunderstood
brgya phrag bcu gyis as brgya rtsa bcu gnyis or brgya dang bcu gnyis.
Sa-pan thus holds that reasoning or pramapa that is objectively grounded
can only function on the surface level, the level of transactional usage, where
negation and proof are possible. In this he accords with a doctrine expounded by
Säntaraksita in his MA 77. See also Y. Kajiyama (1976), p. 130 and below. Cf.
above, KhJ III 37, autocommentary, and note 95.

AS, Asanga already had specified that trustworthy scripture (yid ches pa'l lung!
aptágana) was teachings that do not contradict the first two pramapas. See W.
Rahula (1971), p. 182, and Gzhan-dga', p. 379.1 (190a.1).

reading ldog instead of lkos (line b) and die instead of Lies in N (line d). The
KhJ version is identical to that found in RTRG, Pp. 249.1.6-2.1. For the inter-
pretation of this verse see Go-rams-pa, Rgyas pali, p. 57.2.
The Sanskrit of this verse, following Miyasaka (1971/72), p. 146, is:

"''KJ B and Gomit: "two (pramūnas)," though D has it. Cf. Mokpäkara-
gupta, Teh 4 (Kajiyama (1966), p. 30):
By the word 'twofold' are refuted the different opinions which [clas-
sify valid knowledge into] one, three, four, five and six kinds. That
is to say, the Cārvāka recognizes only one valid cognition, i.e. per-
ception; the Sankhya perception, inference and verbal testimony
Sabda); the Naiyayika perception, inference, identification (upamana),
and verbal testimony: the Prabhākara perception, inference, verbal
testimony, identification and presumption or postulation (arthapatti);
the [Bhatta-] Mimaņsaka perception, inference, verbal testimony, iden-
tification, presumption and non-existence (abhava).
Kajiyama, ibid., note 27, also refers to the same account with slight variations
in the Tarkasopana of Vidyakarasanti. See G. Tucci (1956), p. 277.4-10.
For a similar list see M. Hattori (1968), p. 78, note 1.12, which is
ultimately based on H. N. Randle (1930), p. 305. Here in addition to the above,
the Vaidesika are said to recognize two means of knowledge: perception and infer-
ence, while the Paurāņikas recognize eight. In maintaining two pramapas, the
Vaisepikas actually were not in fact very different from the Naiyayikas, for they
classified the comparison and verbal authority of the latter within their pramapa
of inference. See K. Potter (1977), p. 174. For another summary of the pramāpas
maintained by the different schools, see S. C. Chatterjee and D. M. Datta (1939),
pp. 55-68.
*'°Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJSh, p. 2896.6, states that one reason Sa-pan did
not expatiate here in the KhJ was because he had already investigated this topic
in detail in the Rigs gter rang'grel, and that the error of this opinion was well
known to all: tshad ma riga pa'i gter las zhib tu dpyad pa dang/ 'di dag 'khrul
par thans cad la raga pasdirma spros so zhes ssungsso/ I have not identi-
fied which passage or passages in the Rigs gter rang 'grel are referred to.
We. Frauwallner (1961), p. 131, assigned the date c. 400-480 to the
logician Vasubandhu, as opposed to the earlier Vasubandhu (Asanga's brother), who
flourished c. 320-380. However, it is simpler to assume instead that there were
two phases in the career of one and the same Vasubandhu, who flourished in the
late-4th century. Bhavaviveka (Bhavya) can be placed c. 500-570. See D. Seyfort
Ruegg (1982), p. 513.



It is interesting that Bhavaviveka, who was probably a younger contemporary
of Dignāga and who "evidently wished to utilize methods developed by the Buddhist
logico-epistemological school headed by ... . Dignāga" (D. Seyfort Ruegs (1981),
P. 61), was nevertheless classified doctrinally as belonging to the earlier school
of Pramāņa. See also Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma'i ndo, P. 8.7: ansama ni thoss
med ached dang legs ldan sora yin la phyi ma ni phyoga kyi elang po'i tjes
"brang la 'chad pa bzhin no/.
According to Ngag-dbang-chos-grags, Bod kyi mkhas (Derge ed.). p. 160, some
scholars held that the Indian scholars of Pramāņa could be grouped into three
periods: early, middle, and late. But Ngag-dbang-chos-grags himself follows just
the exposition of Sa-pan in the KhJ and in this connection quotes KhJ III 54-55.
Glo-bomkhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 239a.4-254.3, was one of those who followed a
threefold division. For him, in the first period there came the Buddhist logi
cians before Dignāga, including the arhat *Dharmatrata (Chos-skyabs) and Vasu-
bandhu. In the middle period he placed Dignaga and Dharmakirti. In the last
period he put all the subsequent scholars of Pranāņa.

The logical relations (brel pa : sambandha) of Identity and causation
are the bases for the two logical reasons of "nature" (rang bzhin gyi rtage :
svabhavahetu) and "result" (bras ba'i rtags : käryahetu), respectively. The
third reason, "non-apprehension" (mi daigs, pa: anupalabdhi) is ultimately a
variety of "nature." See E. Steinkellner (1974), P. 117, note 1. The Rige ster



443
rang'grel, chapter 6 (pp. 190.2.6-201.1.5), is devoted to an investigation of the
logical relations of the terms of an inference.
On these relations, see also E. Steinkellner (1971), pp. 202f (cited by E.
Steinkellner (1974), p. 118, note 2), Y. Kajiyana (1966), p. 72, and Th. Stcher-

This is very similar to the major premise in
an

Aristotelian syllogism.

"Expansive in brevity" (nyung rgyas). See also RTRG, p. 260.2.2, where
it is explained that for the inexpert (ai skhas pa) one should use the nyung rayas
form with its two branches:
blun po la ni nyung rgyas sbyar//
tshig yan lag gayis pa'i nas tu sbyar te stes 'gro dang phyogs chos brjod pa
chos mthun pa nyad kya ngas/ dper, na gang byas pa de mittag ste bumpa bzhin
sara yang byasso//. For an expert or learned man (mkhas pa), however, the



"reason" itself is sufficient (p. 260.2.5):
mkhas pa la ni stan tshigs nyid//
gtan tshigs brfod pas khyab pa dran nus per shes pa de la stan tshiga tsan gyis
grub ste dper na byas pala mi rtag par khyab par smra bali rol ba mkhas pa de
la 'o na skra yang byas so zhes brfod pas 'grub po//. But Sa-pan adds that in a
formal debate that is conducted in the midst of an assembly one should use the
fuller form of expression. In this connection he quotes PV I 27.
The phrase nyung rgyas became the subject of scholastic discussion in the
later Sa-akya-pa school. Ngag-dbang-chos-grags, Bod kyi mkhas (Derge ed.), P.
165.3, explains the term as meaning the same in the KhJ as in the Rige ster rang
'rrel, and he indicates his uncertainty about Shakya-mchog-Idan's interpretation
of the term because the latter is not clearly supported by the Rise ater rang
grel: sgrub ngag br jod tahul la yan lag. Inga ldan las tshig nyung la don rgyas

And on P. 236.4, Ngag-dbang-chos-grags points out again the different
interpretation of Shakya-mchog-ldan: rigl) gter du/

Shakya-achog-ldan, Tshad ma rigs...rnas bshad, p. 723.1, can be seen to
explain nyung as a brief expression and rgyas as a longer expression of a formal
proof: tshul sum mi shes pa'i rrol ba blun po la ni/ thog mar rtsod geht gang

Shakya-schog-ldan, Tshad ma rigs...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 385.1.
***The basis for the theory of a two-membered argument form was stated
positively by Dignaga in his PS III 1. He also rejects the longer argument form
in his Nyayamukha. See Y. Kajiyana (1966), pp. 72€, note 185.

faults in the passage beginning: chos can la dang por, yod pa nyid rab tu bsgrub

kindly located this passage (which occurs very near the start of the work) in VN

19tsherme byin kaptakoddhara. According to the Venerable Khenpo
Appey, "thorn" (tsher na may here be understood as "[potential] fault" (skyon).
According to Shakya-nchog-Idan, the procedure of "extracting thorns" was one of
the three essential steps of the advancing of the initial position" (phyogs snga
purvapakşa) by the proponent (angar rrol ba : purvavadin) in a debate. See his
Tahad ma rigs...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 302.2: rtsod pa'i skabs su phyoge snga malog
par khas len pa'i gang zag de sngar sgol syi mtshan nyid/ phyoga saga ma og
pa't tahul la yang sum ste/ dam bca' jog pa dang/ sgrub byed god pa dans/
taher ma byin pa'o//. (For a summary of the duties of the respondent, see ibid.,
p. 304.3.)
Below (p. 303.6), Shakya-mchog-Idan mentions two incorrect ways of "thorn
removal" and states the one correct way: tsher ma 'byin pa la/ tsher ma byin
rayu med bzhin du 'byin pa dang/ yod kyang ni 'byin pa dang/ li ltar yod pa
bzhin du 'byin nus pad. The former two are mistakes that constitute defeats for
the proponent.
Shakya-mchog-ldan's most detailed discussion, however, is found below, PP.
322.7-323,5. Thorn removal is there said to be proper only to the proponent, and
it has two procedures: (1) the proponent's own denying of faults in his probans,
and (2) his stating of the fault of the refutation made by the respondent: tsher

mention of the KhJ, it is clear that Shakya-mchog-ldan had that work in mind when
describing this procedure.
Finally, Shakya-mchog-Idan (ibid., p. 340.4) describes in more detail the
"thorn removal" to be practiced by the proponent when the respondent states a
fallacious rebuttal. Not only may he remove the thorns of his own thesis and
reason, but he may "insert thorns" (tsher ma fug) into the fallacious rebuttal of
the opponent.
The Madhyamika, however, does not follow this procedure. He need not
"remove thorns" because he advances no independent formally stated proof or "ayl-
logism." See Shakya-nchog-ldan, Dbu ma rnan, vol. 14, p. 445.1.
Sa-pap's description of "thorn removal" in KhJ III 56-57 was considered by
Shakya-mchog-Idan (mkhas jus dris lan, p. 120.5) to be one of the "original"
contributions made in the Khu. Such "extraction of thorns" is also known from
other Indian traditions of debating. Y. Bagchi (1953). P. 570, describes the
extraction of thorns (kaptakoddhara) in Naiyayika debate, basing himself on the
Vädavinoda of Sankara Mišra (1. c. 1450). See also the edition of the latter by
G. Jha (Allahabad: 1915), p. 11, lines 18-19. For the Natyayika there are five
"thorna" to be removed, for he maintains five fallacies of the reason (het vabha-
30 that require negation:
(1) vyabhicărin "vandering" (wanaikantika "uncertain")
(2) viruddha "contradictory"
(3) asiddha "unestablished"
(4) setprati paksa "having an equally justified counter-inference"
(5) badhita "sublated"
These five are maintained for instance by Jayanta Bhatta (late-9th century) in his
Nyayaman jari. See K. Potter (1977), p. 394. Y. Bagchi (1953), p. 570, also
relates that there exists a completely different tradition of "thorn extraction."
It is a procedure of eliciting the formal argument of the opponent through inter-
rogation, and it is said to be explained in Mathuranātha TarkavagIda's commentary
or the Avayava section of the Tattvacintamani. On this ters cf. also S. C.
Vidyabhusana (1920), p. 333, note 4.

Vädavinode: "having extracted the thorns in this way, the disputant will stop; and
then his opponent will point out the faults in the hetu put forward by the
former."

CU This is ananubhāsapa (rtes su mi smra or cjes su smra ba med pa). the
sixteenth occasion of defeat mentioned in the Nyaya Sutras and the fourteenth in
Sa-pan's list in KhJ III 5.
LUThis supposed occasion of defeat is discussed at length in the VN (S),
D. Shastri (1972), pp. 109.6-114.6; and VN (D), pp. 349a.5-350b.7. See also RTRG,
pp. 255.3.5-256.1.2.
In this connection Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJNSH, p. 2925.1, refers to a story
of Devendrabuddhi repeating and then refuting five hundred purvapaksas. He con-
cludes that this must be an incorrect account. He also thinks that the practice
of some of his contemporaries of putting forward many theses concerning one basic
treatise--as a way of displaying their wide knowledge-- was not in accord with Sa-
pan's teachings. He sums up (p. 293.4) by saying that the debating in his day
was simply that of childish persons testing their knowledge and that therefore it
is difficult to apply the terms "fault" and "virtue" to it. Cf. above, KAJ III
15, autocommentary.

*Papratibha (spobs pa med pa or mi spobs). This is the eighteenth defeat

chos can ma grub: "dharyasiddha (=aśrayāsiddha), "unestablished sub-
ject or locus." For Buddhists this is one type of failure of the first of the
three relations (tshul sum: trairupya), namely, the failure of the reason's
presence in the subject. The reason too is thus "unestablished" (asiddha). A
systematic and detailed analysis of this fallacy does not seem to have been made
by the great masters of Indian Buddhist Pramana. Among the Naiyayika, Uddyotakara
in his Nyāyavärttika (re: NS 1,2,8) discerned three types of asiddha fallacy:
(1) where the logical reason Chetu) is as much in need of proof as the
probandum (sādhyasama)
(2) where the locus of the hetu is not established (asrayāsiddha)
(3) where the hetu can be explained in a way other than that which would make
it a proof (anyathāsiddha
Seq K. Potter (1977), p. 319. Cf. G. Jha tr. (1983), vol. 1, p. 515. On other
classifications, see S. Sanghvi (1961), p. 100.
Of these three, the unestablished locus or subject became a topic for much
discussion among the later Indian Buddhist logicians and their Naiyāyika oppo-
nents, especially in connection with the proof of universal momentariness in its
positive and negative contraposed forms. This problem has also stimulated a
number of modern discussions. See for instance S. Mooker jee (1935), pp. 29: D.



449
Seyfort Ruegg (1970), pp. 3016; A. C. S. McDermott (1970); B. K. Matilal (1970)
and (1971), pp. 130f; J. L. Shaw (1974); K. Mimaki (1976), p. 60; and K. Potter
(1977), p. 204.
The problem of the unestablished locus has been briefly touched on by Sam
par above, KhJ III 20, in connection with the scope of scripture in debate: A
"completely hidden" (shin tu lkos syur) object such as the existence of future or
past lives is in some sense unestablished since it is not established by the two
pramanas. He also discusses it in much more detail in his RTRG, P.
connection with fallacies of reason (rtaga ltar snang: het vâbhasa). There he
discerns three main varieties of this fallacy:
(1) Unestablished in fact (or with regard to real objects) (don la ma grub
DE)
(2) Unestablished with reference to cognition (blo ngorma grub pa
(3) Unestablished with respect to the opponent (rgol ba la ltos te ma grub
pa)
The subdivisions of these and their examples as subsequently expounded by Sa-pap
in his Rigs gter rang 'grel are as follows:
(1) don la ma grub pa
(a) chos can evi ngo bo ma grub pa (the essential nature of the subject is
unestablished)
(1) misrid nas ma grub pa (unestablished, being impossible). For
example, "The self is omnipresent" (cf. NB III 67) or "The sound of
absolute truth is impermanent." (RTRG, p. 242.2.5)
(11) srid kyang rtsod gzhir ma grub pa (subjects that, though possible,
are not established as the basic subject of debate) (RTRG, P.
242.2.6). For example: "Sound is an audible object" or "Sound is not
an audible object." (Here any reason will do; the fault is in the
thesis.] Go-rams-pa, Sde bdun ndo, p. 609.6, in connection with (I)
(2) (b) below, comments that if the subject and predicate are identi-
cal as in the above case, the basic subject of debate is not estab-
11shed. Sound is by definition an audible object, and thus the thesis
really asserts nothing. But regarding the second example, this seems
to be nothing but an egregious self-contradiction.
(b) rtags kyi ngo bo ma grub pa (the essential nature of the reason is
unestablished)
(1) misrid nas ma grub pa (unestablished, being impossible). For
example: "This person possesses a self, because he possesses the
quality of self(hood)" or "because he was poked by the horn of a



hare."
(11) srid kyang shes 'dod dang na 'brel nas ma gruba (though possible,
the reason has no logical connection with what is desired to be known,
1.e. with the subject of inquiry)
A. Dgo bo ma yin nas ma grub pa (unestablished, not being [the
same) nature). For example, "Sound [1s impermanent), because it
is an object apprehended by the eye." (Cf. NB III 60)
B. Idorm tha dad med nas ma grub pa (unestablished, in that there
does not exist a difference of differentiated concept)
1. Xh1 rtage tha dad med pa (no difference between subject
and reason). For example, "Sound (is impermanent) because
it is sound."
2. chos rtags tha dad med pa (no difference between predicate
and reason). For example, "[Sound) is impermanent, because
it is impermanent."
(c) de dag ri phyoga re la ma grub pa (unestablished in just a part of those)
(1) tags chos can al phyoge gci8 la ma grub pa (the logical mark is
not established in part of the subject)
A. rigs kyi spyt chos can du bzhag pa (setting forth the general
concept of a class as the subject) (242.3.5). For example,
"Trees possess a mind, for they sleep." (This is unestablished
from three points of view.) Or "Sound is impermanent, because it
arises from effort." (It overlooks water and wind sounds.)
B. tshore kyi spyi rtage su byas pa (making the general concept of
a group or assemblage to be the logical mark). For example, "The
three relations of the terms of an inference (tshul gaum) is a
sound reason, for this is able to show a reason to be sound."
(11) tags kyl phyogs scig chos can (la?] ma grub pa (part of the
logical mark is not established [in] the subject)
A. Kiga kyi spyt azhi rtags su byos pa'1 tshe mtshunga pa
1. grub ma erub mtshunga pa
2. grub par mtshungs pa (242.4.3)
B. tahoge pa'i gzhi (?) gzhi rtage su byas pali tshem shunga pa
(2) ble ngorma grub pa (unestablished with respect to the cognizing mind)
(242.4.6)
(a) chos can la the tahom za ba (doubt regarding the subject)
(1) Des rung med nas the tshom za ba (doubt, in that there does not
exist an ascertainable object). For example: putting forward a demon's
pot as the subject.



(11) nes tune yod kyang the tshom za be (doubt even though there
exists an ascertainable object). For example, to put forward a Jewel
as the subject when one has not ascertained whether it is a gloving]
Jewel or a lamp (that one sees).
(b) Itags la the tshom za ba (doubt with regard to the reason)
(1) nges rung med nas the tshom za ba (doubt since there does not exist
an ascertainable object). For example: [The pot is impermanent)
because it is made by the freedom from desire.
(11) nges rung yod kyang the tshom za ba (doubt even though there exists
an ascertainable object). For example, when one doubts whether it is
smoke or water vapor (on the pass), to put forward smoke as the
reason. (Cf. NB III 64)
(c) de enyis kyi 'brel pa la the tahom za nas ma grub da (unestablished since
one doubts the connection of those two).
(1) nges rung med nas the tsbom za ba (doubting something which is not
determinable). For example: "Previous merit exists, because it is the
cause of present happiness (Go-rama-pa reads: bde)."
(11) nges rung yod kyang the tshom za ba (doubting something which is
[otherwise) determinable) (243.1.3). For example, "In the middle one
of three caves there is a peacock, for the peacock's cry is heard
(though the hearer is not sure from which)." (CE. NB III 65-66)
(3) rgol ba la Itos pa't ma grub pa (unestablished with reference to the discus-
sants) (243.1.3)
(a) gol barang pyid la ma arub pa (unestablished for the proponent him
sell). For example, when a Samkhya adherent says, "Thought and happiness
are unconscious, for they possess an origination" or "because they are
impermanent." Here the Sankhya does not in fact maintain originating and
destruction. Instead, he is said to maintain mngon par gal ba (abhi-
vyakt1?) and nye bar zhi ba (upaśänta?).
(6) phyir gol ba la ma grub pa (unestablished for the respondent). For
example, when the Jaina says, "A tree possesses a mind, for it dies if you
peel off the skin." (CE. NB III 61)
Examples of (3) are classified as unestablished with regard to the philosophical
tenets of the opponents, but in fact they are from the point of view of the
Buddhist dialectician unestablished by virtue of the nature of the subject or
reason, 1.e. they belong to (1) (a) or (1) (b) in the above scheme. See KTRG, P.
243.2.3.



Go-rama-pa, Sde bdun ndo, p. 609.1 (kha 113a,1), expands some of the exam-
ples in the above. See also his Tshad ma riga, pp. 543.3-547.3 (272a-274a).
Shakya-mchog-ldan, Tshad ma rigs...mnam bahad, P. 677.4. observes that the
opinions of the great early dialecticians of Tibet were not unanimously decided on
the subdivisions of the unestablished reason because the basic Indian sources were
not clear on this score. Rngog lo-tsä-ba, for instance, followed a basic fourfold
classification, while Phyva-pa in his Bsdus pa taught a sevenfold classification.
Shakya-mehog-Idan (ibid., p. 676.2, 676.7) describes both systems in detail. CE.
Shakya-uchog-ldan, Tshad ma rige...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 86.5, where Rngog's position
is described after that of Dharmottara (based on his NB commentary and the Prana-
paparikpa). For Dharmakirti's discussion in NB III 59-67 and Dharmottara's
comments, see Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. 2, pp. 172-179. See also Stcher-
batsky's own discussion of hetvābhāsa in 1bid., vol. 2, p. 179, note 3. See also
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sdebduni mdo...rnam bshad, P. 364.2-6 (192b.2-6), where the
Acarya Jetāri is said to have maintained a tenfold classification.
"In the Rigs gter rang'grel both the horn of a hare and a self (bdag:
atman) as subjects would be classified as (1) don la ma grub pa, (a) chos can gyi
BRO bo ma grub pa, (1) chos can syi ngo bo mi srid nas ma grub po. See above,
note 207. Here the locus is not established as a really existing thing, and it is
considered an impossib11ity. According to the Buddhist dialectician, then, (and
in harmony with the Buddha's answering through setting aside certain questions as
unedifying), the self cannot be a subject of meaningful discussion. See also
Mokpakaragupta, TBh 25.1 (Y. Kajiyana (1966), pp. 119 and 121).
According to Tsong-kha-pa, some Tibetan dialecticians such as Phywa-pa held
that "an independent 'syllogism' is not proper for an [unreal) subject designated
by 'others' (1.e. by non-Buddhists]" (gzhan syie base palichos con la rang gyud
mi rung). See Tsong-kha-pa's Dbu ma rgyan si sin bris, p. 776.5, as cited by T.
Tillemans (1984a), pp. 365 and 383.
A demon's pot (sha za'i bumpa : pisaca hasa?) and freedom from desire
('dod chage dang bral ba: vitarāga?) as subjects would be classified in the Rigs
gter rang grel as (2) blo pror ma grub pa, (a) chos can la the tshom za ba, (1)
nges tune med nas the thom za ba. They are not established as subjects in
relation to a cognizing mind, and they are a matter for doubt, being impossible to
ascertain, See above, note 207.
-Mental direct perception (yid kyi mngon sum : nanasapratyaksa) and the
non-contingent or non-dependent (Itos med: nirapeksa) as subjects would seem to



be classified in the Rigs gter rang 'grel as (1) (a) (ii): though possible, not
established as a subject of meaningful debate. See above, note 207. They may
also belong to the class of subjects that are unestablished with reference to the
opponent, 1.e. (3) rgol be la Itos pa'i ma grub , subjects that are problematic
when debated on by followers of different philosophical schools.
The mănasapratyaka is, according to the Naiyayikas, the faculty which
perceives the livātman, Buddhists maintain a quite different manasapratyakga. See
S. Mookerjee (1935), p. 311, and Y. Kajiyama (1966), P. 120, note 324. The
Buddhist view on mental direct perception and its Naiyayika criticisms are dis-
cussed by Th. Stcherbatsky (1930-32), vol. 2, pp. 311-339, and S. Mooker jeg
(1935), pp. 309-315. See also TBh 6.1 (Y. Kajiyama (1966), pp. 45-47).
Something non-contingent or independent of other causes (tos med 1 nir-
apeksa) is permanent and non-efficacious. Dharmakirti uses non-contingence as a
reason in refuting a permanent agent such as a creator God in PV II 268. See also
TBh 28 (Y. Kajiyana (1966), pp. 130-132). Buddhists also argue that destruction
is a necessary characteristic of every impermanent entity; this being subject to
destruction is thus not contingent on causes. See K. Potter (1977), p. 62. Sa-
pan, RTRG, p. 195.1.3, discusses and rejects an objection that non-contingence is
not established:
jig pa rayu azhan la Itos phyir//
1tos med 'di ni ma grub 10//
See also RTRG, p. 195.4.5. The motive for teaching ltos sed is explained in RTRG,
P. 198.2.1: 1tos med ni mu stess, byed 'sa' zhia dngos po rnams 18 tavu dans
phrad na kila lama phrad na mi jie par "dod pa la 'ing par khas len na rayu la
- Itos par rang gis 18 par "grub pa yin cing/. See also Shakya-tachog-Idan,
Tshad ma rise...dgongs, vol. 9, p. 106.2. The opposing position of the Natyayi-
ka--that an entity requires a cause for its destruction is called sahetukavi-
nisatva. See also the Buddhist critique of this by Ratnakirti in K. Mimaki
(1976), pp. 125ff.
***Cogrub byed] sgrub bya dang mtshungs. pa'i ma grub pa. This is one of
the four reasonings that constitute the pramaga of inference for the Prasangika.
See above, note 157. This reasoning is basically to reply to the proponent that
his reason is not established (rtaga ma grub) because it is just as much in need
of proof as the probandun. This sort of fallacy has had a long history of discus-
sion in the Nyaya school. In NS 1,2,8 the sadhyasama is listed as one of five
fallacies of the reason hetvābhāsa). See B. K. Matilal (1974), pp. 212, and K.
Potter (1977), p. 196. Uddyotakara in the NBh classified it as an unestablished
Casiddha) reason. In the Buddhist Pramāņa tradition too this sort of reason would



454
be classified as "unestablished" (ma grub pa: asiddha). It is usually a case
where the reason 18 not present in some or all instances of the subject. See note
207, where in the Rigs gter rang 'grel this would be classified as (1) (c) (1)
rtage chos can syi phyoga gcig la sa grub pa. For an example of this type of
reason, Sa-pan gives the argument by a Jaina: "Trees possess mind, for they
sleep." Sa-pan (RTRG, P. 242.3.5) explains that such a reason is unestablished
from three points of view: (1) If the Jaina means "to retract the leaves)" as "to
sleep," then that reason is not established in one part of [the class of] trees
[because not all trees exhibit this). (2) If he means "to doze" by "to sleep."
then the reason is by its nature unestablished [i.e. it is untrue of the subject).
(3) The reason they sleep" is not established for the (Buddhist) respondent with
respect to the tenets he upholds. The basic example of the NBh (on NS 1,2,8) is
"A shadow is a substance, because it has movement." In these instances the
sādhya sama involves a fault of circularity of reasoning or "begging the question"
(petitio principii), though here this is not the specific fault of identity of
reason with predicate of the thesis. Sa-pan (see above, note 207) classified the
latter fault in particular as (1) (b) (ii) B.2: chos rtags tha dad med pe. In the
previous examples it is just that the premises are unreal and require the conclu-
sion (1.e. the thesis) for their proof.
The sadhya same of the Madhyamika seems usually to be the same as that of
the Nalyayika. The main difference is that here it is sünyata which shows the
reason to be unreal and in need of proof, just as it dissolves any other concep-
tually conceived entity. If the proponent (someone who maintains the existence of
entities) adduces any thing as his reason, it has the same unreality as the basic
probandun. K. Bhattacharya (1974), pp. 228f, translated the Madhyamaka sådhyasama
as "equal to the object or thesis to be established" or "sembable a l'objet à
démontrer," and he attempts to differentiate it sharply from the use of the term
by the Naiyāyikas. But see also B. K. Matilal (1974), p. 222.
Go-rams-pa, Royal ba, P. 269.1 (ca 135a.1) discerns two main applications
of this reasoning: (1) as a reply to the proponent's statement of proof, and (2)
as a rejoinder to an opponent's rebuttal. These two types go back to Nagarjuna's
two different mentions of sadhyasama in MMK IV 8 and 9, respectively. Go-rama-pa
states that the first embraces more than the fallacy of unestablished reason
"When the proponent puts forward some 'true properties' (bden pa' chos) (as
probans), the presence of the reason in the subject (phyoga chos is not estab-
lished. If he puts forward some 'appearing properties' (snang ba't chos) as
probans), the pervasion (khyab pa) [i.e. the presence of the reason in like
instances) is not established. And for both cases he is not able to show an
example which is established by a means of knowledge."

41 The proof of the existence of Isvara through "the putting forward of
such things as 'shape' (dbyibs : sannivesa)" refers to the argumentation of Avid-
dhakarņa. The latter is widely quoted in Indian philosophical literature as
having propounded two arguments for the existence of Isvara. The reasonings are
as follows (K. Potter (1977), p. 339):
(1) An object, perceptible by the two sense organs, or not perceptible at
all, 1s produced by a conscious cause, because it possesses an arrangement
among its parts, like a pot, etc., or atoms, etc., respectively.
(2) Material causes (upädäna) of an organism are dependent upon an intelli-
gent Being, because they possess color, etc., like threads, etc.
On these two see also Umesha Mishra (1957-66), vol. 2, p. 57.
Sa-pap perhaps learned of the first of these from Kamalasila's TSP,
Isvaraparikså chapter, commenting on TS 47. On the Parljika account, see K, Mimaki
and A. Akamatsu (1984), pp. 753, note (i), and 763f, where Dbus-pa Blo-gsal's

On this verse see also K. Bhattacharya (1974), p. 225; B. K. Matilal (1974), pp.
221f; and D. Seyfort Ruegg (1981), p. 12.
"On the rayu mtshan mtshungs pa'i mgo snyoms and the other Prasangika
reasonings, see above, note 157. Here Sa-pan seems to indicate that the prin-
ciple behind the Madhyamaka sadhyasana also applies to the other Prasangika rea-
sonings.
Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KhJnSh, p. 294b.4, in his comment on KhJ III 64 refers
to Vasubandhu's Vyākhyāyukti (Rnam bshad rispa) as explaining another way of
answering, though it apparently has no direct connection with this verse.
4. This opinion is attributed to Phywa-pa by Shakya-uchog-Idan, Tshad ma'i
mdo, P. 38.6. On this passage see also Tom J. F. Tillemans (1984), p. 63; cf. L.
van der Kuijp (1983), p. 84. Phywa-pa held that there were three and only three
replies to fallacious refutations in the form of prasahsas, namely, those listed
in KhJ III 65. The third reply, 'dod thog, is synonymous with 'dod pa grub or
just 'dod. (No separate explanation seems necessary for thog in the sense of "in
addition to." CE. T. Tillemans (1984), p. 63.) Sum-pamkhan-po, Dpag bsam ljon
bzang, P. 197, in a disparaging comment also links the earliest use of certain
prasanga forns with Phyva-pa, though he seems to be speaking only in a very
general way: chapachos seng gis (sic) dus nas dar ba't thal brdab thalskad
"khor, gaun bskor ba'1 sgra gang che la gran pa ci/.
Phyva-pa's student Gtsang-nag-pa also followed this classification, though
he is said to have devised his own colorful terminology for the prasahgas to which
each answer corresponded. According to Shakya-mchog-ldan, Tshad mutige...rnam
bshad, p. 739.7, these were:
(1) The consequence which causes no contradiction with the proponent's posi-
tion and which can be answered as "Agreed" was called "the peacock over-
coming poison" (rma bya dug joms).



(2) An "unestablished" (ma grub pa) consequence for which the proponent
replies "the reason is unestablished" was called "the hero with arms cut
off" (dpal bo lag rdum).
(3) A consequence of unestablished pervasion was called "a catapult for
weapons [?]" (mtshon cha'i khri sgyogs).
(4) The sound consequence which stymies the proponent was called a "meteor-
ite" or "lightning-bolt-consequence" (gnam leaga thox thal 'gyur).
(Note that the fourth is not fallacious and thus does not have a corresponding
reply.) Such classifying and systematizing seem to have been typical of Gtsang-
nag-pa and some of his contemporaries. See also Gtsang-nag-pa's classifications
of the rgyu mtshan atshunga pa'i mgo snyoms in Go-rama-pa, Rgyal be, P. 267,4 (ca
134a.4), and the names for the four types of Prasangika reasonings ascribed to
Zhang Thang-sag-pa in Shakya-mchog-ldan, Dbu ma rnam, vol. 15, p. 404.1-3.
The threefold system of Phywa-pa and his followers is presented as a purva-
paksa by Sa-pan also in his RTRG, P. 263.4.1:
thal 'gyur lan ni 8go &sum zhes//
kha ba can pa de skad smre//
bod rhama thal syur ayi lan la stan tshigs ma grub/ khyab pa me grub/ 'dod thor
ces sue las mi srid dol zhes zer rol.
This threefold system was continued within the bedus grwa traditions of the
Dge-luge-pa. See T. Tulemans (1984), p. 66, note 13, and Geshe Lobsang Tharchin
(1979), pp. 218€.
21 This argument is also found in the RTRG, p. 263.2.1, though differently
phrased: 'di mi 'thad de/
gal dang na nges gcig tu Ryur//
'dod na Itar snang gnyis su 'gyur//
de Itar gtan tshigs ltar snang kun//
ma grub acis tu 'du bar syur//
Mkhas-grub-rje criticized this in his Tshad ma ade bdun syi rayan vid kyi mun sel,
p. 178, and Shakya-achog-Idan, Rigs ater...rnam bahad, p. 738.6, replies to him,
as Mr. s. Onoda pointed out to me. He also informed me that Jam-dbyanga-bahad-
pa, Badus ra, p. 480, gives a fivefold system and seems to harmonize the Rise ater
and bsdus ra traditions, including even a fifth answer: the tshom za ba.
4 PV I 15; cf. PVin II 68 (E. Steinkellner (1973), pp. 1001). This verse
is found in PV (D). P. 95a.6, PV (P), p. 1905. The only difference between the
Tanjur and KhJ versions is that the latter has 'di Instead of de at the start of
line b. The Sanskrit text (Miyasaka [1971/72], p. 116) is:



458
hetos trişv api rūpesu
niscayas tena varpitah /
asiddhaviparitartha-
vyabhicarivipakşatak 11
41 This criticism is evidently directed against a Tibetan dialectical
practice of his day. His point seems to be that the use of the particle kyang may
lead to ambiguity in that it indicates the possible existence of the predicate in
similar Instances. See also RTRG, p. 263.4.5 (da 2198.5), where the same topic is
treated briefly:
Moreover on an occasion of contradiction ('gel ba), if one replies,
"The pervasion is unestablished," a mistake will arise. For example,
to the proponent) who maintains that sound is produced, (there is the
respondent's] consequence which indicates a contradiction: "Because it
is made, It entails being permanent." If [the proponent) saye to this,
"So what if, even though made, it is impermanent? The pervasion is not
established," he must accept implicitly that permanence is possible
for something made. Just as when "[because it is) a knowable thing" is
put forward as the reason [for the consequence, it is permanent").
Shākya-mchog-ldan, Tshad ma rigs... Enam bshad, p. 739.3, comments in this connec-
tion that if one replies to a contrary pervasion (khyab pa 'alba) with the
answer "The pervasion is not established," one will mistake contradictory con-
sequences gal ba'i thal syur as being actually uncertain consequences (Banges
pa'i thal 'gyur): khyab paigal ba la khyab pa ma grub pa'i lan btab nad sal
ba't thal 'gyur yang dngos kyis ma nges pa'i thal 'yur du "khrul ba'i phyir/.
ce. Go-rams-pa, Sde bdon ndo, p. 671.2 (kha 144.2), who merely summarizes the
Rigs ter rang 'rrel. See also the discussion of Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sdebdun
ndo...rnan bahad, p. 406.6 (2035.6) and Tshad ma rigs, p. 414, who quotes there at
length from the autocommentary to KhJ III 67. None of these commentators eluci-
dated in any detail Sa-pan's comments about the impropriety of the particle kyang.
The general meaning of the basic verse and autocommentary seems to require
a negative sense for the phrases br jod deos in both occurrences (text, P. 153,
lines 8-9, 15). The point of this passage is that this sort of reply should not
be made. He indicates that kyang is not admissable as a concessive particle,
ecause he considers it to have conjunctive force. But brjod midgos is awkward,
as is brfod si dgos; moreover, neither is attested. Therefore the best way to
explain br jod dgos is that Sa-pan is indicating here what the opponent must
state.



459
2 The same position is found in the RTRG, P. 264.1.1:
des na mkhas pas thal 'syur lan//
roam par thar pa'i sgo bzhis gdab//
thal ba'i lan la nt/ galma ages ma grub/ 'dod pa grub pa ste sgo bzhi'//

bdag la bstod cing szhan la sod pa ni thabs sduge pe yin pos bden pa'i rjes su
'brang ba dam pa'i rham par thar pa vin noll.
In this connection T. Tillemans (1984), p. 66, note 13, observes the "He
[i.e. Sa-paņ) argues for four kinds of reply, dividing unestablished implications
(khyab pa ma grub) into two sorts, contradictoriness gal ba) and uncertainty (ma
nges pa), thus transferring to the theory of consequences some of the terms more
usually associated with the classification of fallacious reasons (gtan tahiga 1tar
snang: het vābhāsa)."
Sa-paņ considered the principles behind the classification of fallacious
reasons and fallacious consequences to be the same, namely: conflicting with the
"three modes" (tshul gsun) of inferential relation. In his system there were thus
four types of fallacious consequences:
(1) 'gal ba'i thal 'gyur
(2) ma nges pa'i thai 'gyur
(3) ma grub pa'i thal 'gyur
(4) bsal ba ve med kyi thal 'gyur
See Shakyo-mchog-Iden, Tshad ma rigs...rnam bahad, p. 739.5. The irrefutable,
unanswerable consequence is called 'khor gum tshang ba'i thal 'gyur, according to
Shakya-nchog-Idan.
In his Mkhas pa, p. 119€, Shakya-nchog-Idan identifies Sa-pan's treatment
of how to reply to fallacious consequences as another of his "original" con-
tributions in the KhJ.
“Here the proponent must also have maintained that sound is impermanent.
Otherwise he would not be stymied. The ultimate goal of the "Prasangika" method
of argumentation is just this: to leave the proponent stymied in the knowledge
that any of the responses involves him in a contradiction. One should keep in
mind, however, that all respondents phrased their replies through this type of
argumentation, not only Prasangika-Madhyantkas.
Glo-bo akhan-chen, KhJNSh, p. 2956.1, comments that if the proponent finds
himself in the position of being stymied, he should not resort to the ignoble
responses that Sa-pop lists in KhJ III 13: KTRG, p. 252.1.5; and Nga brevad ma'i,



460
p. 149.2.1. On these see above, notes 26 and 27.
*Note the difference between the basic verse and the autocommentary of
KHJ III 69. Nothing in the autocumentary corresponds to the "bangags pa'l
phyirl khas pa't skye bos" in the basic verse. But in Khenpo Appey's opinion,
this does not impair the passage.
Cf. RTRG, p. 264.1.3:
de Itar bsgrub dang sun 'byin gyi//
rigs pa'i gzhung lugs gang gis shes/
mkhas pa de ni rdzogs pa vi//
sangs rgyas rnams kyi bstan pa "dzin//
225 on the duties of the witness, see Shakya-mchog-Idan, Tshad ma
rigs...dgonge, vol. 9, p. 323.5. One of the basic duties of the arbitrating
witness is to repeat accurately what each of the debators said. See also above,
note 12.
22This verse is quoted by Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...rnam bshad, p.
284,1 (1926.1). Sa-paņ in the RTRG, P. 251.4.6, adds that some great scholars say
that in a great debate the arbitrating witness will not be able to deny or falsify
what each opponent said if he correctly repeats both of their statements and then
sets down in writing the main points of philosophical tenets that they contain.
22% In this connection Glo-bo mkhan-chen, KAJNSH, P. 287a.4, quotes a verse
attributed to Icārya Sūra:
'chi bdag bstan pa sa chen gyi//
khams gsum dag na spyod byed pa//
si belog thogs, pa ma nchis pa'ang//
khyod kyi batan pas zil gyis znan/
Z2D According to the Khush, p. 297.5, this verse explains Sa-pan's motive
for composing the treatise. On p. 297b.3, Glo-bo mkhan-chen expands this a
little, saying that the first pair of hemistiches reveals the motive, while the
second pair is his injunction to the reader) to enter into these three "doors."
According to the KhJNSh, p. 297b.3, this verse reveals one reason he has
not expatiated at great length: it is difficult to get a chance to benefit others.



According to the KhJNSh, ibid., this verse explains that the author did
not elaborate in great detail because most people become satisfied with learning
just a little, and there are very few who maintain the complete Buddhist doctrine
through exposition, composition, and debate.
"bstan pa'i mjus dir. This verse reflects Sa-pan's opinion on the
chronology of the Buddhist doctrine. He had calculated in 1216 that 3,350 years
had already elapsed since the Nirvana of the Buddha, and that the Buddha's Doc-
trine was thus nearing its final phases. He mentions this calculation near the
end of his biography of Rje-btsun Grags-pa-rgyal-intshan: Rte btsun, Lam 'bras slob
bshad, vol. 1 (ka), p. 289.2. This reckoning had the approval of Grags-pa-rgyal-
mtshan and went back to the calculations of Bsod-nams-rtse-to in his Chos la jug
pa'i sro
Sa-pan mentions that his teacher Sakyasribhadra upheld a different chrono-
logy (which is much closer to the datings of modern historians). The latter
calculated in 1210 that 1,753 years had passed since the Nirvana, thus putting its
date in BCE 544 instead of BCE 2133. On these chronologies, see also "Gos lo-tsa-
ba, Debther (G. Roerich (1976), pp. 1063ff); Bu-ston (E. Obermuller tr. [1931),
pp. 106ff); Ariene Macdonald (1963), PP. 64ff and 120€, notes 56 and 57; A.
Vostrikov (1970), pp. 101ff; and D. Seyfort Ruegg (1966), p. 33, note 1.
This verse, according to the KhJNSh, pp. 297a.6 and 298a.4, explains the
special characteristics of the time of composition and the author.
This same image is also used by Sa-pap in his Chas lo'i, p. 414.1.1:
deng sang thub pa dag gi bstan pa yang//
"bab chu skam pali mtsho bzhin rnam par bri//
chos spyod phal cher de yi srog chaga bzhin
bshes anyen ngan rnans chu skyar bzhin du crys/
The image of the receding pond filled with trapped fish was used by the Buddha
himself. See Suttanipata 936 (as translated by N. Aranaki (1983), p. 64): "When I
contemplated that all] living beings (in this Sansăric world) are thrashing about
desperately hither and thither, like fish left in waters diminishing
(rapidly]...." Another similar passage from Sa-pan's works (not yet located)
1s quoted by Glo-bo mkhan-chen, Sde bdun mdo...rnan bahad, p. 409.3 (205.3):
de Itar bde bar gshegs pa'i bstan pa yang
ston ka'1 chu bzhin myur du bri ba dang//
Cf. ThGS, p. 50.1.1:
deng sang shakya thub pa'i bstan pa "di//



bud shing zad pa'i me bzhin ayam chung bas//
Cf. also his Jig rten dbang phyug, p. 397.1.4:
bde bar gshers pa'i batan pa yang//
mar me shum zad ji bzhin du//
ring por mi thog nub par gyur//.
And in Glo bo lo tsa ba'i, p. 415.1.6:
deng sang bde bar gshegs pa'i bstan pa ni//
ston ka'1 (415.2] shing bzhin 'bras bu phal cher lhags//
According to the KhJNSh, p. 297a.6, this verse explains how others need
to exert themselves. For this he also quotes from the DS:
rin chen chos kyang dkon la ni//
rtag tu 'tshe ba mang zhes gsunga//
'di la bsam nas mkhas rnams kyis//
rtag tu bstan pa'i phyi dor bye//
He also quotes more extensively from the passage in Chag lo't quoted in the
previous note. The line in chen chos kyang dkon la rtas tu tshe ba mang ori-
ginates from the Prañaparamita Ratnagupasapcayagatha.
253This verse, according to the KhJNSh, p. 297a.6, is the dedicatory trans-
fer bango ba of the merit from composing this work.
4*cf. the similar closing lines of Sa-pap's LSh, p. 61.2.3-6; J. E. Bosson
(1969), pp. 9f; and Sdeb sbyor sna tshoge, p. 141.3.4.

Three other fragments of the same Glo-bo manuscript survive in the Toyo Bunko,
Tokyo (MS vol. no. 42):
(17) Bstan bcos mkhas pa't kha rayon (incomplete) (TB no. 109). Vol. ma, fols
2639-266a. (missing one folio?)
(18) Sdom pa gsum svi rab tu dbye be (TB no. 24). Vol. tsha, fols. 2105-278b.
(missing one folto at the end?)
(19) Bsngo ba yon bshad dang bcas pa (TB no. 100). Vol. dza, fols. 314a-323b.
(missing one or more folios at end.)
The last was probably the final work in this manuscript set of Sa-pan's writings.
(20) Tshad ma riga pa't gter (gyi 'grel pa] (TB no. 20). A 301-page manuscript of
this work, forming vol. ts of this set, is preserved in the library of H. H.
the Sakya Trizin, negative reproduction (black ink on white paper) has
recently been brought out by the Sakya Centre (Dehra Dun 1985) under the
title: Tshad ma rige gter rtsa ba dang rang 'grel.
Thus well over half of this four-volume set (consisting of vols.ma to dza) is
known to survive-scattered in Nepal, India and Japan--including most of his major
works. Rearranged in their original order, they are:
vol. ma, ff. 36-154 - nos. (1) to (3)
ff. 263-266 - no. (17)
vol. tsa, ff. 1-301 - no. (20)
